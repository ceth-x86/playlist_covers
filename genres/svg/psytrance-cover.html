  PSYTRANCE — Playlist Cover
  Design System: Playlist Cover v1

  SONIC DNA ANALYSIS:
  ═══════════════════
  Psytrance's defining sonic features:
  1. HYPNOTIC REPETITION, NOT CLIMACTIC ARC — the fundamental
     difference from uplifting trance. Where uplifting trance
     builds to a defined peak and releases, psytrance creates a
     SUSTAINED ALTERED STATE through relentless, minimally-varying
     repetition. The pattern continues. The pattern continues. The
     pattern shifts by 2%. The pattern continues. Over 8 minutes,
     the cumulative micro-changes create a trance state — not
     through climax but through persistence.
  2. THE SQUELCH — the acid/303-derived bass pattern that defines
     psytrance's low end. Relentless 16th-note bass pulses with
     resonance-swept filter cutoffs that create the characteristic
     "squelch" or "zap" texture. This is not house's warm sub-bass
     or dubstep's wobble — it's an ALIEN, mechanical, squelching
     pulse that never stops.
  3. LAYERED MICRO-PATTERNS → EMERGENT COMPLEXITY — psytrance builds
     complexity not through composed arrangement (avant prog) or
     improvisation (jazz) but through LAYERING simple patterns.
     Pattern A (bass pulse) + Pattern B (hi-hat grid) + Pattern C
     (acid line) + Pattern D (delay feedback) = emergent
     interference patterns that are more complex than any single
     layer. The complexity is EMERGENT, not composed.
  4. OUTDOOR/RITUAL CONTEXT — psytrance is outdoor music: Goa
     beaches, forest festivals, desert raves. UV light, fluoro
     decoration, 12-hour sets from sunset to sunrise. The music is
     designed for RITUAL — sustained communal altered states in
     natural settings, not club dancefloors.
  5. 140-148 BPM RELENTLESS DRIVE — same tempo range as uplifting
     trance but a completely different relationship to it. Uplifting
     trance's BPM drives toward a peak; psytrance's BPM maintains
     a PLATEAU. The speed is sustained, not accelerating.
  6. PSYCHEDELIC PROCESSING — delay feedback spirals, granular
     textures, bit-crushed alien sounds, reversed elements, pitch-
     shifting. The signal processing IS the psychedelia — not
     through consciousness expansion (psychedelic rock) but through
     SONIC ALIENATION. Making familiar sounds unfamiliar through
     extreme electronic processing.

  VISUAL TRANSLATION:
  ═══════════════════
  Background: Deep UV-dark (#08060e) — darker than psychedelic rock's
    purple, with more ultraviolet quality. The darkness of an
    outdoor festival site at 3am, lit only by UV and lasers.
  Central form: THE INTERFERENCE PATTERN — two overlapping geometric
    systems that create emergent visual complexity:
    System A: concentric circles (the bass pulse — regular, mechanical,
      relentless). Centred slightly left.
    System B: a second set of concentric circles, centred slightly
      right, offset from System A.
    Where the two systems overlap, the line intersections create
    a MOIRÉ-LIKE interference zone — emergent visual complexity
    from two simple patterns layering. This IS psytrance's core
    principle: simple repetitive patterns creating complex emergent
    results through layering and interference.
    This is the first INTERFERENCE-BASED form in the system.
  Glow: UV-green (0.06) — the fluorescent, black-light quality
    of outdoor psytrance. Not warm gold (jazz/house/spiritual) or
    cool azure (uplifting trance) or neon pink/cyan (synthwave).
    UV-green is the colour of psytrance festival culture: fluoro
    paint, UV-reactive decorations, the eerie glow of black light.
  Grain: 18% — moderate. Digital production with deliberate
    texture from granular processing and bit-reduction. The alien
    texture quality of processed sound.
  Displacement: scale=3 — same as psychedelic rock and dubstep.
    The signal IS warped — delay spirals, pitch-shifts, granular
    decomposition. Psytrance shares the warped-perception aesthetic
    with psychedelic rock but through digital means.
  Blur: stdDev=3 — moderate. Less diffuse than psychedelic rock (8)
    or uplifting trance (5). Psytrance is SHARP in its repetition —
    the patterns need to be FELT precisely for the hypnotic effect
    to work. The clarity of a 4am outdoor dancefloor.
  Particles: 4 UV-fluorescent motes — representing the alien
    micro-sounds that emerge from the layered patterns: the
    unexpected harmonic, the accidental resonance, the ghost tone
    that appears when two patterns interact. Green-tinged,
    fluorescent quality.
  BPM: ~145 BPM → 21 ticks at 13px, kick weight 0.5px (solid,
    relentless). THE MOST TICKS IN THE SYSTEM — faster even than
    uplifting trance (20 at 14px). But unlike uplifting trance's
    identical-weight ticks, psytrance has a subtle 16th-note
    PULSE PATTERN — a barely-perceptible accent pattern encoded
    in the tick opacities, representing the squelch pattern
    beneath the kick.

  FAMILY PLACEMENT:
  ═══════════════════
  Trance family:
  House → Trance → Uplifting Trance (euphoric climax)
  House → Trance → Psytrance (hypnotic plateau)
  These are OPPOSITE responses to trance's foundation:
  Uplifting builds to a peak; Psytrance maintains a state.
  Psytrance also connects to:
  - Psychedelic Rock: shares the expanded-consciousness intent
    and the warped-signal aesthetic, but through electronic rather
    than analog means. The spiral in psychedelic rock is organic
    expansion; psytrance's interference is mechanical alienation.
  - Acid House: shares the 303 squelch lineage. Psytrance is
    acid house's squelch accelerated, layered, and alienated.
  - Minimal Techno: shares the hypnotic-repetition principle,
    but psytrance adds psychedelic processing and higher BPM.
  Key artists: Infected Mushroom, Astrix, Hallucinogen (Simon
    Posford), Shpongle, Vini Vici, 1200 Micrograms, Ace Ventura,
    Ajja, Hilight Tribe, Electric Universe

  COLOUR RATIONALE:
  ═══════════════════
  Deep UV-dark (#08060e): outdoor festival darkness, ultraviolet
  UV-green (#30c868 → #28a850 → #20883c): the signature psytrance
    colour. Green is psytrance's identifying hue the way azure is
    uplifting trance's — the colour of UV-reactive paint, of
    fluorescent decoration, of nature (outdoor setting) viewed
    through artificial light. This green is ALIEN — not the organic
    olive-green of Canterbury but the toxic, fluorescent, UV green
    of extreme processing.
  Phosphor green-white (#90e8a0): the brightest interference zone —
    where the two pattern systems overlap and the emergent
    complexity peaks.
  Dull violet accent (#705888): the UV-light colour beneath the
    green, the ultraviolet substrate of the festival aesthetic.

    THE INTERFERENCE PATTERN
    ═══════════════════
    Two overlapping concentric circle systems — System A centred
    slightly left, System B centred slightly right. Where the
    circles from both systems intersect and overlap, emergent
    visual complexity arises — a moiré-like interference zone.

    This encodes psytrance's core principle:
    Simple Pattern A + Simple Pattern B = Complex Emergent Result
    (bass pulse)      + (acid line)      = (hypnotic trance state)

    CRITICAL DISTINCTION from other circular/radial forms:
    - Chicago House radial pulse: SINGLE centre, expanding outward
      (one heart, one rhythm)
    - Psychedelic Rock spiral: SINGLE centre, expanding outward
      with echoes (one consciousness expanding)
    - Psytrance interference: TWO centres, overlapping
      (two patterns creating emergent third)

    The two-centre structure is unique in the system.

    INTERFERENCE ZONE HIGHLIGHTS
    ═══════════════════
    In the overlap region between the two circle systems
    (~x: 200-242), the visual density is naturally higher
    (more line intersections). We enhance this with subtle
    highlight marks at key intersection points — bright green
    flashes where the two patterns constructively interfere.

    These represent the EMERGENT TONES — the ghost harmonics,
    the phantom rhythms that appear when two simple patterns
    layer. The sounds you hear that neither pattern contains
    individually.

  BPM STRIP — ~145 BPM, relentless squelch pulse
  ═══════════════════
  21 ticks at 13px — THE MOST TICKS and TIGHTEST SPACING in the
  entire system. Faster than uplifting trance (20 at 14px).
  Kick weight 0.5px (solid, relentless).

  SUBTLE SQUELCH ACCENT PATTERN — unlike uplifting trance's
  perfectly identical ticks, psytrance encodes a 16th-note
  pulse variation: a barely-perceptible accent pattern in the
  tick opacities. Groups of 4 with the FIRST tick slightly
  brighter — the downbeat of each 16th-note group, where the
  bass squelch's filter sweep peaks.
