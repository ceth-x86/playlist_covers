  MINIMAL TECHNO — Playlist Cover #160
  Design System: Playlist Cover v1

  SONIC DNA ANALYSIS:
  ═══════════════════
  Minimal Techno's defining sonic features:
  1. SUBTRACTION AS METHOD — the core principle. Start with
     techno's full grid (Detroit). Remove everything that isn't
     essential. Then remove one more thing. What remains is
     minimal techno: one kick, one percussion element, one
     textural element, and SPACE. The space between sounds is
     the primary content — the negative space that gives each
     remaining element maximum presence and maximum meaning.
  2. MICRO-VARIATION — the compositional technique. Instead of
     changing elements (adding, removing, switching), minimal
     techno changes PARAMETERS of existing elements by the
     smallest perceptible increment. The hi-hat opens 2% wider.
     The kick gains 0.5dB. The filter moves 50Hz. Over 8
     minutes, these imperceptible changes accumulate into a
     transformation — but at ANY given moment, the track sounds
     "the same." The art is in the perception of change below
     the threshold of conscious awareness.
  3. THE KICK AS SKELETON — unlike progressive house (kick as
     anchor for transformation) or Chicago house (kick as heartbeat),
     minimal techno's kick is the SKELETON — the bare structural
     frame onto which minimal tissue hangs. The kick is dry,
     precise, unremarkable. It provides temporal structure.
     Nothing more.
  4. SPACE AS CONTENT — the defining aesthetic. In Chicago house,
     every frequency band is occupied. In trance, the spectrum
     fills as the build intensifies. In minimal techno, MOST of
     the frequency spectrum is EMPTY most of the time. A click
     in the treble. A kick in the bass. Everything between is
     OPEN. The space isn't a gap or a rest — it's the primary
     material. You listen to the space between sounds.
  5. LOOP CONSCIOUSNESS — minimal techno loops are SHORT (2-4
     bars) and CONSTANT. The loop doesn't build to anything or
     transform into something else (progressive house). It just
     PERSISTS — and the persistence creates a meditative state
     where the listener's attention shifts from the WHAT (what
     sounds are playing) to the HOW (how the micro-parameters
     are changing within the loop).
  6. CLICK CULTURE — the sonic palette favours CLICKS, TICKS,
     and MICRO-PERCUSSION over pads, chords, and melodies.
     Glitch-influenced: the digital artifacts of CD skipping,
     of buffer underruns, of processing errors elevated to
     musical elements. The sounds are SMALL — not big (trance
     pads), not heavy (metal guitars), not rich (orchestra).
     Small, precise, exact.

  VISUAL TRANSLATION:
  ═══════════════════
  Background: Pure dark (#060608) — nearly achromatic but with
    the faintest blue-grey quality of a dark club. Not warm
    (minimal techno isn't warm), not purely black (there IS
    light), not coloured (no atmospheric hue). The darkness of
    a dancefloor at 4am where the only light is from the
    DJ's laptop screen.
  Central form: THE SPARSE FIELD — a small number of precisely
    placed micro-marks distributed across the canvas space,
    each representing one minimal percussive/textural element.
    The marks are TINY — the smallest intentional marks in the
    system. They're evenly but not symmetrically distributed
    (there's a subtle grid logic but it's not rigid). The
    space BETWEEN the marks is the primary visual content —
    just as the space between sounds is the primary sonic
    content.
    At the centre-left: a slightly larger, slightly brighter
    mark — the KICK. Not dominant (schranz's wall) or radiant
    (house's pulse) or constant (progressive house's anchor).
    Just the largest element in a field of small things. The
    skeleton.
    COMPARISON:
    - Detroit Techno grid: FULL 2D array (all cells populated)
    - Minimal Techno sparse field: MOSTLY EMPTY space with
      few precise marks (most cells empty)
    Detroit is the full grid. Minimal techno is the grid after
    subtraction — most cells removed, a few remaining.
  Glow: Near-zero (0.02) — the DJ laptop screen. Cold, dim,
    functional. No atmosphere.
  Grain: 12% — CLEAN. Minimal techno is precise digital
    production — no analog warmth (space ambient), no tape
    hiss (classical ambient), no distortion (metal). The grain
    is the digital noise floor: present, low, exact.
  Displacement: scale=0 — ZERO. Each click is exactly placed.
    Each kick is exactly timed. The precision IS the aesthetic.
    No wobble, no drift, no warping. Everything is WHERE it
    should be.
  Blur: stdDev=1 — SHARP. Clicks need to be sharp to be
    heard as clicks. A blurred click becomes a pad; a sharp
    click is a click. The precision of the micro-elements
    demands clarity.
  Particles: The micro-marks ARE the particles. The form IS
    made of particles. Unlike every other genre where particles
    are decorative/atmospheric ADDITIONS to a central form,
    minimal techno's micro-marks are BOTH the form AND the
    particles. The distinction collapses. Everything is
    micro-detail.
  BPM: ~128 BPM → 16 ticks at 18px, kick weight 0.38px
    (LIGHT — the lightest kick in a rhythm-bearing genre).
    The four-on-the-floor stripped to minimum: barely there,
    precise, skeletal. Every tick identical. No accent pattern.
    No variation. The skeleton.

  FAMILY PLACEMENT:
  ═══════════════════
  Techno → Minimal Techno (the reductive wing)
  Techno → Detroit Techno (the functional original)
  Techno → Hard Techno → Schranz (the brutal extreme)

  Minimal Techno and Schranz are OPPOSITE responses to techno:
  - Schranz: MAXIMUM density (fill everything, compress to wall)
  - Minimal Techno: MINIMUM density (empty everything, leave space)

  Both use repetition. Both create hypnotic states. One by
  overwhelming. One by reducing. Wall vs void. Schranz fills
  ALL the space; minimal techno empties MOST of it.

  Connects to:
  - Minimal Ambient: shares the reductionist principle but
    minimal ambient removes the BEAT (pure reduction); minimal
    techno retains it (reduction with rhythm)
  - Detroit Techno: minimal techno IS Detroit Techno minus most
    of its grid. Same heritage, different density.
  - Progressive House: shares the hypnotic quality and patience
    but progressive house TRANSFORMS (the gradient shifts);
    minimal techno PERSISTS (the loop continues with
    micro-variation)
  - Glitch: shares the click/digital-artifact aesthetic but
    glitch is experimental/non-functional; minimal techno is
    functional/dance

  COLOUR RATIONALE:
  ═══════════════════
  Pure dark (#060608): the dancefloor at 4am
  Cool grey-white (#a0a8b0 → #909898 → #b0b0b8): the colour
    of digital clicks — no warmth, no saturation, no personality.
    Cool, neutral, precise. The faintest blue-grey quality of
    LED light. Each mark slightly different in brightness
    (the micro-variation principle) but all within the same
    narrow tonal range. The palette says: nothing is loud,
    nothing is bright, nothing demands attention. Everything
    whispers.
  Kick mark: slightly warmer grey (#a8a098) — the one element
    with any sub-bass weight, the one element that has physical
    (body) presence rather than purely digital presence.

    THE SPARSE FIELD
    ═══════════════════
    A small number of precisely placed micro-marks distributed
    across the canvas. Each mark represents one minimal
    percussive/textural element: a click, a tick, a micro-
    percussion hit.

    The marks are the SMALLEST intentional marks in the entire
    system — circles of r=0.6–1.2, the tiniest visible presences.
    They're distributed with a subtle spacing logic (not random,
    not rigidly gridded) — the careful placement of a producer
    who places each click EXACTLY where it needs to be.

    The SPACE BETWEEN marks is the primary visual content —
    the vast dark emptiness that gives each tiny mark maximum
    presence. This is the visual equivalent of minimal techno's
    defining aesthetic: listening to the space between sounds.

    Detroit Techno's grid is FULL — all cells populated.
    Minimal Techno's field is SPARSE — most of the grid has
    been removed. What remains is the absolute minimum
    necessary to create hypnotic movement.

    THE KICK: at centre-left (195, 220), slightly larger
    (r=1.8) and slightly warmer (#a8a098) — the skeleton,
    the one element with physical weight.

    MICRO-ELEMENTS: scattered around the kick, tiny
    (r=0.5–1.0), cool grey-white, each at a slightly
    different brightness (the micro-variation principle).

  <!--
    THE KICK — the skeleton
    The largest mark in the field. Not dominant, not radiant,
    not pulsing. Just the biggest thing in a world of tiny things.

  <!--
    MICRO-ELEMENTS — the clicks, ticks, and digital details
    ═══════════════════
    Each mark is precisely placed. Each is slightly different
    in size and brightness — the micro-variation that makes
    minimal techno alive despite its apparent stasis.

    The distribution follows a loose spatial logic: clustered
    more densely near the kick (elements relate to the pulse)
    and sparser toward the edges (the space extends outward).
