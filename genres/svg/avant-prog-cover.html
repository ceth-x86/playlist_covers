  AVANT PROG — Playlist Cover
  Design System: Playlist Cover v1

  SONIC DNA ANALYSIS:
  ═══════════════════
  Avant Prog's defining sonic features:
  1. DISSONANCE AS ARCHITECTURE — not dissonance as shock (noise),
     nor dissonance as accent (post bop), but dissonance as the
     PRIMARY BUILDING MATERIAL. Univers Zero constructs entire
     compositions from intervals that conventional music treats as
     tension-requiring-resolution. In avant prog, the tension IS
     the resolution. The building stands on angles.
  2. COMPOSED COMPLEXITY — unlike mainstream prog which balances
     complexity with accessibility (the memorable riff, the singable
     chorus), avant prog is FULLY composed with no commercial
     concession. Pieces are 15-25 minutes of through-composed,
     non-repeating structure. No verse-chorus. No hook.
  3. EXTENDED TECHNIQUES — bowing behind the bridge, prepared piano,
     multiphonics on woodwinds, unusual percussion (brake drums,
     industrial scrap). The instruments are played "wrong" by
     conventional standards, but systematically so.
  4. ASYMMETRIC STRUCTURE — time signatures that change every bar,
     sections of unequal length, forms that resist pattern recognition.
     Where mainstream prog uses 7/8 or 5/4 as a GROOVE, avant prog
     uses 11/16 followed by 7/8 followed by 13/16 — the asymmetry
     IS the form.
  5. CHAMBER MUSIC + ROCK — the instrumentation bridges: violin, oboe,
     bassoon alongside electric guitar and drums. But unlike chamber
     pop (which is gentle), avant prog's chamber instruments are
     played with AGGRESSION and extended technique.
  6. RIO / ZEUHL / CANTERBURY EXTREME — three tributaries converge:
     Rock in Opposition's political angular music (Henry Cow, Art Bears),
     Magma's ritualistic alien repetition (Zeuhl), and Canterbury's
     absurdist jazz-prog pushed to its experimental limits.

  VISUAL TRANSLATION:
  ═══════════════════
  Background: Cold dark grey (#0a0a0c) — austere, intellectual,
    deliberately unwelcoming. Not the warmth of jazz or the
    velvet of baroque pop. Avant prog does not invite; it demands.
    Grey because this music exists in a monochromatic intellectual
    space — between the warmth of rock and the coldness of
    academic composition.
  Central form: THE FRACTURED POLYGON — an asymmetric closed shape
    with unequal sides and non-standard angles. NOT a regular polygon
    (that would be techno's geometric precision). NOT a circle or
    ellipse (that would be organic). NOT a fracture pattern (that
    would be destruction). This is a CONSTRUCTED form that deliberately
    refuses conventional geometry — like a composition that uses
    complex structure but rejects familiar patterns.
    Internal structural lines visible: the compositional scaffolding,
    the analytical framework that holds the dissonance together.
    These internal lines are the "score" — the composed structure
    that makes avant prog ORGANIZED rather than chaotic.
  Glow: Cold silver (0.04) — minimal, clinical. The light of
    a rehearsal room, not a concert hall or stage.
  Grain: 20% — moderate. Acoustic/electric hybrid recording.
    Not as polished as chamber pop (15%) or baroque pop (14%),
    not as rough as garage rock. Avant prog's recording aesthetic
    is functional, not luxurious.
  Displacement: scale=2 — moderate tension. The forms are under
    compositional STRESS — the angles and structures push against
    each other. Not destruction (power electronics) but internal
    pressure.
  Blur: stdDev=1 — MINIMAL. Avant prog is precise and sharp.
    Every dissonance is intentional, every angle is calculated.
    The sharpest blur in this session (tied with power noise).
  Particles: 0 — ZERO. Like trap and power noise, but for a
    different reason. Avant prog has no decoration, no ornament,
    no shimmer. Every element is structural. There is nothing
    extraneous. Where baroque pop ornaments, avant prog strips
    to the skeleton.
  BPM: ~130 feel but IRREGULAR → 13 ticks at VARIABLE spacing
    (no two gaps identical), kick weight 0.5px (moderate).
    The most metrically complex BPM strip yet — every interval
    between ticks is different, representing the constantly
    shifting time signatures.

  FAMILY PLACEMENT:
  ═══════════════════
  Progressive Rock family:
  Classic Prog → Symphonic Prog → Neo-Prog (mainstream branch)
  Classic Prog → Art Rock → Avant Prog (radical branch)
  Avant Prog is the EXTREME of progressive rock's experimental
  impulse — the endpoint where "progressive" means "refusing all
  convention" rather than "elaborating on convention."
  Connects to:
  - Post Bop: shares angular composition and intellectual rigor
    but post bop is rooted in jazz tradition; avant prog deconstructs
    rock tradition
  - Chamber Pop: shares the chamber instrumentation but OPPOSITE
    aesthetics: chamber pop is gentle/ornamental; avant prog is
    aggressive/structural
  - Power Noise: shares the zero-ornament austerity and structural
    focus but through completely different sonic means
  - Free Jazz: shares the extended techniques and anti-commercial
    stance but free jazz IMPROVISES; avant prog COMPOSES
  Key artists: Henry Cow, Univers Zero, Magma, Art Bears,
    Art Zoyd, Thinking Plague, Present, Aranis, Gentle Giant
    (early, as bridge), Ruins (Japanese)

  COLOUR RATIONALE:
  ═══════════════════
  Cold dark grey (#0a0a0c): austere, intellectual, monochromatic
  Pale cold blue-grey (#8090a0 → #607080): the colour of
    scored music paper under fluorescent light, the rehearsal
    room aesthetic. Not warm (this isn't baroque), not void-dark
    (this isn't noise), not green (this isn't digital). Grey-blue
    is the colour of ANALYTICAL thought — cool, precise, structured.
  Dull warm accent (#a08860): the vestigial rock tradition —
    the electric guitar's warmth still present beneath the
    compositional surface. Barely visible, like rock DNA buried
    under avant-garde structure.
  White (#d0d0d0) on structural lines: the score, the analytical
    framework, the compositional skeleton.

    THE FRACTURED POLYGON
    ═══════════════════
    An asymmetric closed shape — 7 vertices, NO TWO SIDES EQUAL
    in length, NO TWO ANGLES equal in measure. This is the visual
    equivalent of a composition where no section repeats, no measure
    mirrors another, no pattern recurs.

    CRITICAL DISTINCTION from other geometric forms in the system:
    - Detroit Techno grid: REGULAR, symmetric, functional
    - Electro Industrial sequencer: REPEATING pattern (degrading)
    - Power Noise lattice: GRID structure (rhythm from noise)
    - Avant Prog polygon: ASYMMETRIC, closed, non-repeating

    The polygon is CLOSED (unlike post bop's open-ended axis or
    jazz rock's interweaving lines) because avant prog compositions
    are FULLY COMPOSED — they have defined beginnings, middles, and
    ends. The form is complete, just irregular.

    7 vertices chosen because 7 is the most common "complex" odd
    number in avant prog time signatures (7/8, 7/4).

      INTERNAL STRUCTURAL LINES — the compositional scaffolding
      ═══════════════════
      Lines connecting non-adjacent vertices of the polygon,
      creating internal triangulations. These represent the
      compositional structure that holds the dissonance together —
      the score, the analysis, the framework.

      In avant prog, the structure is VISIBLE: you can hear
      the compositional thought, the deliberate choices.
      Unlike free jazz (where structure is hidden or absent),
      avant prog's structure is its defining feature.

      The internal lines create smaller, irregular sub-shapes
      within the polygon — sections of the composition,
      each with its own character.

    ZERO PARTICLES.

    Every element is structural. Where baroque pop adds
    filigree (7 motes), chamber pop adds breath (3 motes),
    and spiritual jazz overflows (8 motes), avant prog
    strips to the skeleton.

    The ABSENCE of particles makes a statement:
    - Trap (0 particles): negative space as urban aesthetic
    - Power Noise (0 particles): no room, everything is texture
    - Avant Prog (0 particles): nothing extraneous, pure structure
    Three zeroes, three different philosophies of absence.

  BPM STRIP — ~130 BPM feel, FULLY IRREGULAR spacing
  ═══════════════════
  13 ticks, NO TWO GAPS IDENTICAL. This is the most metrically

  signatures that define avant prog:
  11/16 → 7/8 → 13/16 → 5/4 → 9/8 → ...

  - Jazz Rock asymmetric (7+5+5 grouping): structured asymmetry
  - Post Bop displaced accents: even spacing, shifted emphasis
  - Avant Prog: NO PATTERN AT ALL — pure irregularity
