  EBM (Electronic Body Music) — Playlist Cover #155
  Design System: Playlist Cover v1

  SONIC DNA ANALYSIS:
  ═══════════════════
  EBM's defining sonic features:
  1. THE SEQUENCED BASS — the absolute defining element. A
     monophonic analog bass synth playing a repetitive, mechanical,
     quantized pattern. Usually 8 or 16 steps. The pattern is
     SIMPLE — often just 3-4 notes — but RELENTLESS. The bass
     sequence doesn't change for the entire track. It drives the
     body through pure repetitive force. Not melodic (too few
     notes), not rhythmic in the complex sense (too regular) —
     it's a MECHANICAL OSTINATO that targets the solar plexus.
  2. BODY, NOT MIND — "Electronic BODY Music." The name is the
     manifesto. This music targets physical response, not
     intellectual engagement (IDM), not emotional catharsis
     (trance), not spiritual transcendence (spiritual jazz).
     Your body responds before your brain processes. Stomping,
     marching, fist-pumping — involuntary physical responses to
     the sequenced bass and drum machine.
  3. MILITARISTIC DRUM MACHINE — dry, hard, quantized. Usually
     LinnDrum or 808 but programmed without swing, without
     humanization, without warmth. MARCH tempo (120-140 BPM).
     The drum pattern is a COMMAND, not an invitation. You don't
     choose to move; you are COMPELLED.
  4. MIDRANGE AGGRESSION — EBM lives in the midrange (200-2000Hz).
     Not sub-bass heavy (dubstep/trap), not treble-focused
     (hi-NRG), not full-spectrum (trance). The midrange is where
     the bass sequence sits, where the distortion bites, where
     the body feels the impact. The midrange is the PHYSICAL
     frequency range — the frequencies that vibrate your ribcage.
  5. SHOUTED VOCALS — barked, chanted, commanded. Not sung
     (pop), not screamed (metal), not whispered (dark ambient).
     SHOUTED — like a drill sergeant, like a factory foreman,
     like a political agitator. The vocals are IMPERATIVE:
     commands, slogans, declarations.
  6. EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL MINIMALISM — EBM emerged from the
     European industrial scene (Belgium, Germany) in the early
     80s. It takes industrial's mechanical aesthetic and strips
     it to FUNCTIONAL MINIMUM: bass sequence + drum machine +
     shouted vocals. No guitar (rock), no orchestral ambition
     (classical), no psychedelic processing (psytrance). Pure
     machine-body interface.

  VISUAL TRANSLATION:
  ═══════════════════
  Background: Hard dark grey-blue (#08080c) — cold, industrial,
    with a slight steel-blue quality. The colour of a factory
    floor under fluorescent lights at night. Not warm (no organic
    content), not pure black (not dramatic/atmospheric), not
    blue-violet (not cosmic). Steel-dark.
  Central form: THE STEP SEQUENCE — a row of vertical bars
    of alternating height, representing the bass sequencer's
    step pattern. Each bar = one step in the sequence. The bars
    alternate between two heights: TALL (the note is ON,
    the bass sounds) and SHORT (the note is off or at lower
    pitch). The pattern repeats: ON-off-ON-off or ON-ON-off-ON
    creating the visual rhythm of the sequencer display.
    The bars are SHARP — hard edges, no rounding, no softness.
    Perfectly vertical, perfectly quantized, perfectly spaced.
    The step sequence IS EBM. The visual form of the bass
    pattern that drives the body.
    COMPARISON TO OTHER GRID/SEQUENCE FORMS:
    - Detroit Techno grid: 2D array (rows × columns), overhead
    - Indie Synthpop grid: 2D array (3 rows), soft-edged, bedroom
    - Synthwave grid: perspective depth, converging to infinity
    - EBM step sequence: 1D row of bars, varying HEIGHT only
    The step sequence is the most REDUCTIVE grid form — collapsed
    from 2D to 1D. Only one row. Only height variation. Pure
    function: which steps are ON, which are OFF.
  Glow: Near-zero (0.02) — fluorescent fixture, cold, flat.
    No atmosphere. The factory floor doesn't have mood lighting.
  Grain: 22% — moderate-high. Analog distortion on the bass
    sequence, the grit of the drum machine's output stage,
    the raw quality of early 80s industrial production.
  Displacement: scale=2 — the distortion on the bass sequence,
    the slight warping of the waveform under analog overdrive.
    Not extreme (schranz) but present — the bass synth is being
    pushed.
  Blur: stdDev=1 — SHARP. Quantized. Precise. No reverb, no
    atmosphere, no wash. Every step is exactly where it should
    be. The drum machine's dry output. The sequencer's perfect
    timing.
  Particles: 0 — ZERO. Nothing decorative. Pure function.
    The machine has no embellishment. Tenth zero-particle cover.
  BPM: ~130 BPM → 17 ticks at 17px, kick weight 0.55px
    (solid, commanding). MARCH RHYTHM — alternating heavy
    and light ticks encoding the militaristic stomp pattern.
    Heavier than pop rock (0.45px) because EBM's kick is a
    COMMAND. Every other tick slightly heavier = the march
    accent: LEFT-right-LEFT-right.

  FAMILY PLACEMENT:
  ═══════════════════
  Industrial lineage:
  Industrial → EBM (the rhythmic/dance branch)
  Industrial → Power Electronics (the noise branch)
  Industrial → Electro Industrial (the hybrid)
  Industrial → Industrial Ambient (the atmospheric branch)

  EBM connects to:
  - Electro Industrial: EBM + more processing + more aggression
    = electro industrial. EBM is the simpler ancestor.
  - Detroit Techno: both emerged in the early 80s from
    machine music. EBM from European industrial, techno from
    American funk/electro. Parallel evolution toward mechanical
    dance music from different cultural roots.
  - Schranz: EBM's bass-driven aggression accelerated to
    extreme BPM = approaches schranz territory.
  - Minimal Techno: shares the reductive principle (minimum
    elements for maximum physical effect) but minimal techno
    is SUBTLE; EBM is COMMANDING.
  Key artists: Front 242, Nitzer Ebb, DAF, Die Krupps,
    Skinny Puppy, Front Line Assembly, Portion Control,
    à;GRUMH..., Leæther Strip, Pouppée Fabrikk

  COLOUR RATIONALE:
  ═══════════════════
  Hard dark grey-blue (#08080c): factory floor, steel, cold
  Cold steel-white (#b0b0b8 → #a0a0a8): the colour of the
    sequencer display — not warm (no organic content), not pure
    white (too clean), not grey (too neutral). Steel-WHITE —
    the cold luminance of an LED display in a dark factory.
    Faintly blue-shifted, like fluorescent light.
  Dull orange (#c08040): the ONE accent — the active step
    indicator on the sequencer, the LED that shows which step
    is currently playing. Orange because early sequencer
    hardware (Roland, Korg, Moog) used orange/amber LEDs
    for active step indication. This is the only warm element
    on the cover — and it's the warmth of ELECTRONICS, not
    of humanity.

    THE STEP SEQUENCE
    ═══════════════════
    A row of vertical bars representing the bass sequencer's
    step pattern — THE defining visual element of EBM.

    16 steps, each 8px wide, spaced 18px apart (10px gap
    between bars). Two heights encode the bass pattern:
    TALL (40px) = note ON, bass sounds at full pitch
    SHORT (16px) = note OFF or lower pitch/rest

    The pattern: ON-off-ON-ON-off-ON-off-off-ON-off-ON-ON-off-ON-off-off
    A typical EBM bass sequence: syncopated but MECHANICAL,
    driving but QUANTIZED. The pattern creates forward momentum
    through its accent structure while remaining perfectly
    machine-timed.

    One step (the current playback position) is highlighted in
    dull orange — the active step LED, the sequencer's position
    indicator. The ONLY warm colour. The warmth of electronics.

    Starting x = (440 - 16*8 - 15*10) / 2 ≈ 67
    All bars anchored at bottom y = 238, growing upward
    (tall bars to y=198, short bars to y=222)

  BPM STRIP — ~130 BPM, march rhythm
  ═══════════════════
  17 ticks at 17px, kick weight 0.55px (commanding).
  MARCH PATTERN — alternating heavy (0.55px, 0.45 opacity)
  and light (0.35px, 0.22 opacity) ticks encoding the
  militaristic stomp: LEFT-right-LEFT-right.

  The first MARCH-ACCENTED BPM strip in the system.
  Different from:
  - Frenchcore uniform weight (martial wall)
  - Psytrance squelch accent (groups of 4)
  - Pop Rock alternating kick-hat (balanced)
  EBM's alternation is STOMP-step-STOMP-step — the body
  marching, the factory floor rhythm, the drill command.

  Starting x = (600 - 16*17) / 2 = 164
