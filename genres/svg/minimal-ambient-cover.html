  MINIMAL AMBIENT — Playlist Cover #152
  Design System: Playlist Cover v1

  SONIC DNA ANALYSIS:
  ═══════════════════
  Minimal Ambient's defining sonic features:
  1. REDUCTION AS PRINCIPLE — the defining philosophy. Where dark
     ambient has almost nothing because the VOID is vast, minimal
     ambient has almost nothing because the ARTIST CHOSE restraint.
     The reduction is intentional, disciplined, philosophical.
     Not absence — SUFFICIENCY. One sine wave is enough. One click
     is enough. One breath is enough. The art is in the choosing.
  2. SINE WAVE PURITY — the sine wave is minimal ambient's
     foundational sound: a single frequency with no harmonics,
     no overtones, no colour. The most elemental sound possible.
     Where classical ambient sustains complex acoustic tones
     (piano, cello), minimal ambient sustains the SIMPLEST
     possible tone. The sine wave IS the reductionist principle
     made audible.
  3. MICRO-SOUND — sounds at the threshold of perception.
     Not sub-bass rumble (dark ambient) or sustained drone
     (classical ambient). Tiny, precise events: a digital click,
     a breath of noise, a momentary blip. These micro-events are
     COMPOSED — placed with precision, not randomly scattered.
     Each sound is intentional. Nothing is accidental.
  4. DIGITAL PRECISION — where classical ambient is analog (tape,
     wood, strings) and industrial ambient is processed (field
     recordings, concrete), minimal ambient is DIGITAL — clean,
     precise, mathematical. Alva Noto's sine waves, Ryoji Ikeda's
     data-derived frequencies. The computer as aesthetic tool,
     not processing medium.
  5. NEAR-SILENCE — minimal ambient operates at the LOWEST possible
     volume levels. The music rewards attention — you must lean in,
     quiet your environment, focus. The near-silence isn't emptiness
     (dark ambient) or decay (classical ambient). It's an invitation
     to listen harder.
  6. ZEN SUFFICIENCY — the philosophical foundation. Less IS enough.
     A single gesture, repeated with microscopic variation, IS the
     composition. Nothing more is NEEDED. The beauty is in the
     restraint, in the discipline of NOT adding, in the confidence
     that this single element suffices.

  VISUAL TRANSLATION:
  ═══════════════════
  Background: Pure achromatic dark (#070707) — the most NEUTRAL
    background in the ambient family. Not blue-black (dark ambient's
    cosmic void), not warm grey (classical ambient's recital hall),
    not concrete grey (industrial ambient's architecture). Pure
    grey-black — no hue, no temperature, no association. The
    background is as reduced as the music: no colour means no
    connotation. Just dark. Neutral. Clean.
  Central form: THE PRECISE LINE — a single thin horizontal line
    at EXACT vertical centre (y=220), extending across most of
    the canvas width. Unlike every other horizontal line in the
    system:
    - NOT fading (classical ambient's decay gradient)
    - NOT sagging (grunge's weighted droop)
    - NOT oscillating (pop rock's waveform)
    - NOT dense (schranz's packed wall)
    - NOT thick (grunge's 2.5px)
    EVEN. THIN. CENTRED. CONSISTENT.
    The line has uniform opacity and uniform thickness across its
    entire length. It doesn't fade, droop, oscillate, or vary.
    It IS. The line exists because it was chosen to exist.
    This is the sine wave: a single frequency, constant, pure.
    The most DELIBERATE form in the system — every other form
    has variation (dynamic, directional, textural). This form's
    defining quality is its REFUSAL to vary.
  Glow: ZERO. Like schranz but for opposite reasons. Schranz
    has no glow because it's all aggression. Minimal ambient has
    no glow because glow would be EXCESS. An unnecessary addition.
    The line doesn't need atmospheric support. It is sufficient.
  Grain: 8% — THE LOWEST in the entire system. Digital precision.
    No noise floor, no tape hiss, no analog warmth. The cleanest
    possible signal. Even lower than pop rock (12%) or dance pop
    (12%) because minimal ambient is MORE precise than commercial
    pop — the precision is the aesthetic.
  Displacement: scale=0 — ZERO. The sine wave doesn't waver.
    The frequency is exact. Digital precision means NO drift,
    NO wobble, NO deviation.
  Blur: stdDev=0 — ZERO. THE ONLY ZERO BLUR in the entire
    system. No reverb. No diffusion. No atmosphere. The sine wave
    is DRY — present in its exact location, with no spatial
    extension. Where every other genre has at least stdDev=1
    (power noise, avant prog), minimal ambient has stdDev=0.
    The line IS the line. Nothing extends beyond it.
  Particles: 0 — ZERO. The ninth zero-particle cover. The most
    principled zero: not absence (dark ambient), not saturation
    (power noise), not sufficiency (synthwave). DISCIPLINE —
    particles would be excess. The line is enough.
  BPM: NO BPM STRIP — the fourth genre with no rhythm.
    But the reason is unique: minimal ambient has no pulse not
    because machines stopped (industrial) or tempo transcended
    (classical) or void has no heartbeat (dark). Minimal ambient
    has no BPM strip because RHYTHM WOULD BE EXCESS. A pulse
    would be an additional element. The line is enough.

  FAMILY PLACEMENT:
  ═══════════════════
  The ambient quadrant is now complete:
  - Industrial Ambient: ABSENCE (architecture without life)
  - Classical Ambient: PRESENCE (tone still sounding)
  - Dark Ambient: THE VOID (neither presence nor absence)
  - Minimal Ambient: SUFFICIENCY (one element, chosen, enough)

  Minimal ambient connects to:
  - Minimal Techno: shares the reductionist principle but
    minimal techno retains rhythm (it reduces everything EXCEPT
    the beat); minimal ambient reduces everything INCLUDING
    the beat
  - Digital art (Ryoji Ikeda): shares the mathematical/digital
    precision and the sine-wave palette
  - Zen/Buddhist aesthetics: the philosophical foundation of
    sufficiency, of enough-ness, of finding beauty in restraint
  Key artists: Alva Noto (Carsten Nicolai), Ryoji Ikeda,
    Taylor Deupree, 12k Records roster, Bernhard Günter,
    Steve Roden, Tomas Korber, Francisco López

  COLOUR RATIONALE:
  ═══════════════════
  Pure achromatic dark (#070707): neutral, no connotation
  Neutral grey-white (#909090 → #a0a0a0): the colour of the
    sine wave — no warmth (ivory, amber), no cold (blue-grey,
    steel). Pure GREY. The most neutral colour in existence.
    Grey has no emotional temperature, no cultural association,
    no connotation. It is the VISUAL SINE WAVE — a colour
    with no harmonics.
  This is the MOST ACHROMATIC cover in the entire system.
    Even schranz and power noise have off-white and dirty grey
    with faint warm or cool undertones. Minimal ambient has
    PURE grey — rgb values balanced, no channel dominant.
    The visual equivalent of a frequency with no overtones.

    NO filters. NO displacement. NO blur. NO glow.

    No <defs> section needed because there is nothing to define.
    No gradients because the line doesn't fade.
    No filters because the signal is unprocessed.
    No effects because effects would be excess.

    This is the ONLY cover in the entire system with an
    empty (or absent) defs section. Every other cover defines
    at least a displacement filter, a blur, a gradient, a glow.
    Minimal ambient defines NOTHING — because nothing needs
    to be defined. The SVG element draws a line.
    That is all.

  <!--
    THE PRECISE LINE
    ═══════════════════
    y = 220. Exactly centred.
    x: 80 → 360. Symmetric around the centre.
    stroke-width: 0.6px. Thin. Present. Sufficient.
    opacity: 0.4. Quiet. Visible. Not loud.
    colour: #a0a0a0. Pure grey. No warmth. No cold.

    This is the sine wave: a single frequency, constant, pure.
    No harmonics (classical ambient's upper partials).
    No decay (classical ambient's fading gradient).
    No sag (grunge's weighted droop).
    No oscillation (pop rock's wave cycles).
    No dense stacking (schranz's wall).
    No phase echoes (psychedelic rock's trails).
    No ornament (baroque pop's flourishes).
    No excursions (Canterbury's detours).

    Just the line.

    The most DELIBERATE form in the entire system.
    Every other form has variation — dynamic, directional,
    textural, structural. This form's defining quality is
    its REFUSAL to vary.

    One frequency. One amplitude. One position.
    Sustained. Constant. Enough.
