  CHAMBER POP — Playlist Cover
  Design System: Playlist Cover v1

  SONIC DNA ANALYSIS:
  ═══════════════════
  Chamber Pop's defining sonic features:
  1. SMALL ENSEMBLE TRANSPARENCY — where baroque pop deploys a full
     orchestra (60+ players), chamber pop uses 4-8 players: a string
     quartet, a French horn, an oboe, acoustic guitar, piano. The
     CHAMBER MUSIC principle: every instrument is individually audible,
     every part is essential, nothing is doubled for density. You can
     TRACE each voice through the arrangement.
  2. INTIMACY OF SCALE — the music is performed as if in a small room
     (a chamber), not a concert hall. The dynamic range is narrower,
     the recording is closer, the emotional register is confessional
     rather than grand. Where baroque pop says "listen to this
     SPECTACLE," chamber pop says "come closer and listen."
  3. LITERARY SENSIBILITY — lyrics that read like short fiction or
     poetry. Stephin Merritt's wit, Sufjan Stevens' narrative detail,
     Joanna Newsom's mythological density. The words matter as much
     as the arrangement.
  4. ACOUSTIC PRIMACY — acoustic instruments foregrounded. Even when
     electric instruments appear, the acoustic timbres lead: nylon
     guitar, bowed strings, woodwinds, piano. The sound of WOOD
     and BREATH and BOW.
  5. DELIBERATE FRAGILITY — the arrangements are delicate by design.
     Thin textures that could break. A single pizzicato cello note
     carrying a whole measure. An oboe solo over silence. The beauty
     is in the exposed vulnerability.
  6. COUNTERPOINT REFINED — baroque pop's counterpoint made more
     delicate. Each voice moves independently but the total is
     transparent enough to hear all voices at once. Like watching
     4 dancers rather than a corps de ballet.

  VISUAL TRANSLATION:
  ═══════════════════
  Background: Soft warm dark (#0c0908) — similar warmth to baroque pop
    but slightly less saturated, less burgundy. More like the darkness
    of a private room with a reading lamp than a candlelit hall.
    The intimacy of smaller scale.
  Central form: THE DELICATE LATTICE — 4-5 thin, distinct melodic
    lines that interweave with visible separation between them.
    Each line is individually traceable (unlike baroque pop where the
    lush primary melody dominates). The lines are THINNER than baroque
    pop's (0.6-0.9px vs 2.0px) because each instrument is lighter,
    more exposed. They cross and interweave but never merge — you can
    always see each thread.
    CRITICAL CONTRAST with baroque pop:
    - Baroque pop: thick primary + supporting counter + decoration
    - Chamber pop: 4-5 EQUAL thin lines, none dominant
    This encodes the ensemble philosophy: baroque pop has a lead voice
    with accompaniment; chamber pop has equal voices in conversation.
  Glow: Soft warm amber (0.05) — more restrained than baroque pop's
    0.07. The reading lamp, not the candelabra.
  Grain: 15% — clean but with acoustic warmth. Similar production
    quality to baroque pop but slightly more intimate recording.
  Displacement: scale=0 — zero. Like post bop and Chicago House,
    chamber pop is acoustically pure and deliberately unprocessed.
    The beauty is in the natural timbre, unwarped.
  Blur: stdDev=2 — LOW. The clarity of a close recording in a small
    room. Much less than baroque pop's 5 (concert hall) or spiritual
    jazz's 7 (devotional wash). Chamber pop wants you to hear each
    instrument DISTINCTLY.
  Particles: 3 motes — the fewest non-zero in this session (tied with
    Chicago House). Economy. Every element earns its place. Where
    baroque pop has 7 (orchestral shimmer), chamber pop has 3
    (three quiet details — a breath, a page turn, a bow lift).
  BPM: ~110 BPM → 15 ticks at 20px, kick weight 0.3px (very light).
    Gentle, unhurried. The brushed snare rather than the struck kick.
    Dynamics very even — no strong accents, all ticks nearly uniform
    in weight. The rhythm supports without asserting.

  FAMILY PLACEMENT:
  ═══════════════════
  Direct descendant of Baroque Pop — same ornamental/orchestral
  philosophy but REDUCED in scale. The relationship is:
    Baroque Pop (full orchestra, grand) → Chamber Pop (small ensemble, intimate)
  This is analogous to:
    House → Minimal House (full dance → reduced dance)
    Metal → Post-Metal (full aggression → reduced, atmospheric)
  Also connects to:
  - Indie Folk: shares the acoustic intimacy and literary lyrics
    but chamber pop has the classical ensemble training
  - Art Song: shares the compositional precision and small-ensemble
    focus but art song is firmly classical; chamber pop is pop-structured
  - Slowcore: shares the deliberate fragility and quietness
    but slowcore uses rock instrumentation
  Key artists: Belle & Sebastian, Sufjan Stevens (Illinois era),
    The Divine Comedy, Joanna Newsom, Beirut, Andrew Bird,
    The Magnetic Fields, Arcade Fire (early, Funeral)

  COLOUR RATIONALE:
  ═══════════════════
  Soft warm dark (#0c0908): private room, reading light, not stage light
  Muted warm tones for each thread — each line gets a slightly
    different warm hue, representing the distinct timbral identity
    of each instrument:
    - Amber (#c8a060): the cello — warm, wood-toned, the heart
    - Warm rose (#b88078): the oboe/clarinet — reed warmth, breath
    - Pale gold (#d0b880): the piano — ivory, hammered strings
    - Silver-warm (#a8a090): the violin — the highest voice, bright
      but not cold
    - Soft cream (#c8b898): the guitar — nylon, gentle, grounding
  All warm, all muted. No bright colours. Chamber pop whispers;
    it doesn't shout.

    THE DELICATE LATTICE
    ═══════════════════
    5 thin, distinct melodic threads — each representing one
    instrument in the chamber ensemble. Each line is independently
    traceable: you can follow any single thread from left to right
    through the lattice without losing it.

    CRITICAL DESIGN DISTINCTION from Baroque Pop:
    ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ BAROQUE POP:                                    │
    │   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ thick primary (2.0px)     │
    │   ──────────────── medium counter (1.0px)       │
    │   ┈┈┈┈┈┈  ┈┈┈┈  ornaments (0.7px, fragmented) │
    │   → HIERARCHY: one lead voice with support      │
    │                                                 │
    │ CHAMBER POP:                                    │

    │   ──────────────── thread E (0.6px)             │
    │   → EQUALITY: all voices individually audible   │
    └────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

    The lines cross and interweave but maintain distinct colours
    and visible separation. At crossing points, the lines don't
    merge — they PASS THROUGH each other, each maintaining identity.

    CROSSING MARKERS
    ═══════════════════
    Unlike jazz rock's crossing points (bright blend marks showing
    traditions merging), chamber pop's crossings are UNMARKED.
    The lines pass through each other silently — the instruments
    are aware of each other but they don't merge. Each maintains
    its own identity. The transparency is the point: you can see
    both threads at the crossing.

    Instead, we mark the SPACES BETWEEN threads — the breathing room
    that makes each voice audible. Three small, extremely faint
    vertical guides showing the ensemble's vertical spacing.

    1. A breath before singing

    3. A bow lifted between phrases

    The sounds between the notes — the silence that chamber pop
    treats as musical content.

  BPM STRIP — ~110 BPM, gentle pulse
  ═══════════════════
  15 ticks at 20px, kick weight 0.3px (whisper-light).
  VERY EVEN dynamics — no strong accents, nearly uniform.
  The rhythm supports without asserting itself. A brushed
  snare, a gentle bass drum, the rhythm section as furniture
  (essential but unobtrusive).

  Compare to baroque pop's dance-form pattern (ONE-two-THREE-four):
  chamber pop has no courtly dance ancestor — its rhythm is
  simply a gentle, even heartbeat beneath the threads.

  Starting x = (600 - 14*20) / 2 = 160
