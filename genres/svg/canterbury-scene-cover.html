  CANTERBURY SCENE — Playlist Cover
  Design System: Playlist Cover v1

  SONIC DNA ANALYSIS:
  ═══════════════════
  Canterbury Scene's defining sonic features:
  1. THE WHIMSICAL DETOUR — compositions that meander with
     intelligence and humour. Not the focused angular purpose of
     avant prog, not the grand architecture of symphonic prog.
     Canterbury compositions WANDER — they take left turns into
     jazz interludes, pause for Dadaist spoken-word sections,
     break into music hall pastiche, then return to the main theme
     as if nothing unusual happened. The detours ARE the journey.
  2. FUZZ ORGAN — the Lowrey or Farfisa organ through fuzz pedals
     is Canterbury's signature timbre. Warm, buzzing, slightly
     absurd — an instrument that sounds like it's smiling. Mike
     Ratledge's distorted organ on Soft Machine records defined
     the sound.
  3. JAZZ MEETS PROG — unlike avant prog's chamber-music severity or
     symphonic prog's orchestral grandeur, Canterbury fuses prog
     structure with JAZZ VOCABULARY. Extended improvisation over
     complex changes, but played with a looseness and swing that
     proper prog lacks. The musicians could play jazz; they chose
     to play something stranger.
  4. BRITISH ABSURDIST HUMOUR — Monty Python's musical cousin.
     Dadaist lyrics, silly voices, musical jokes, deliberate
     bathos (building to a grand climax then deflating it with
     a kazoo). The humour is INTELLECTUAL but never pretentious.
  5. WARM COMPLEXITY — Canterbury's complexity is APPROACHABLE.
     Unlike avant prog (which confronts) or free jazz (which
     challenges), Canterbury's difficult music is played with
     such warmth and good humour that it feels welcoming.
     Compound time signatures that you tap your foot to because
     the musicians are clearly enjoying themselves.
  6. COMMUNAL CROSS-POLLINATION — the scene was literally a
     community (centered in Canterbury, Kent). Musicians moved
     freely between bands: Soft Machine, Caravan, Matching Mole,
     Hatfield and the North, National Health, Egg. The same
     players recombined endlessly, creating a coherent but
     diverse sonic world.

  VISUAL TRANSLATION:
  ═══════════════════
  Background: Warm dark olive-brown (#0a0a06) — the warmest,
    most organic background in the prog family. Not cold grey
    (avant prog's austerity) or dark blue-black (post bop's
    intellectualism). Olive-brown is the colour of an English
    garden in autumn, of old pub wood, of the organic warmth
    that permeates Canterbury music.
  Central form: THE MEANDERING PATH — a primary line that flows
    across the canvas with gentle, amused curves and 4 small
    SIDE-EXCURSIONS that branch off, curl into little loops or
    detours, and return to the main path. The excursions are the
    Canterbury trademark: jazz solos, humorous asides, unexpected
    genre shifts that always find their way back.
    The line is LOOSER than baroque pop's flowing melody (more
    improvisatory), WARMER than post bop's bent axis (friendlier),
    and GENTLER than avant prog's angular polygon (welcoming
    rather than confrontational).
  Glow: Warm amber-green (0.06) — the unique Canterbury warmth.
    The amber is the jazz/prog tradition; the green undertone is
    the English pastoral quality, the garden, the countryside.
    No other cover in the system has this amber-green.
  Grain: 17% — analog warmth with good production. Canterbury
    records were well-made but not polished — they have the
    warmth of musicians playing in a room together.
  Displacement: scale=1 — gentle. The music is complex but never
    aggressive. The slight displacement is the natural looseness
    of ensemble playing — musicians breathing together.
  Blur: stdDev=4 — moderate room sound. The acoustics of a
    rehearsal space or small club. Warm but not diffuse.
  Particles: 5 whimsy motes — more than chamber pop (3, restrained)
    but fewer than baroque pop (7, ornamental). These represent
    the little musical jokes and surprises — a kazoo, a music-box
    phrase, a silly voice, a quote from another piece.
    Varied sizes and slightly varied warm tones — each joke is
    different, each surprise unique.
  BPM: ~140 feel → 16 ticks at 17px, kick weight 0.4px (light,
    bouncy). The rhythm has a JAZZ SWING — pairs of ticks with
    a slight long-short lilt, similar to UK garage's swing but
    warmer and more organic. Canterbury grooves BOUNCE.

  FAMILY PLACEMENT:
  ═══════════════════
  Progressive Rock family:
  Classic Prog → Symphonic Prog (grand branch)
  Classic Prog → Canterbury Scene (whimsical branch)
  Classic Prog → Avant Prog (radical branch)
  Canterbury sits BETWEEN symphonic prog's grandeur and avant prog's
  severity. It has avant prog's jazz vocabulary and compositional
  ambition but symphonic prog's warmth and accessibility. It's the
  PLAYFUL middle ground.
  Connects to:
  - Jazz Rock: shares the jazz-prog fusion but Canterbury is MORE
    whimsical and LESS virtuosic-display-oriented. Jazz rock shows
    off; Canterbury plays around.
  - Avant Prog: shares the compositional complexity but Canterbury
    ENJOYS its complexity; avant prog CONFRONTS with it.
  - Post Bop: shares the harmonic sophistication but Canterbury adds
    humour. Imagine Shorter's compositions if he'd grown up watching
    Monty Python.
  - Krautrock: Canterbury and Krautrock are parallel experimentations
    in different European traditions — one British/whimsical, one
    German/systematic.
  Key artists: Soft Machine, Caravan, Hatfield and the North,
    National Health, Robert Wyatt, Matching Mole, Egg, Henry Cow
    (bridges to avant prog), Gong (bridges to space rock)

  COLOUR RATIONALE:
  ═══════════════════
  Warm dark olive-brown (#0a0a06): English garden, old wood, organic
  Warm amber (#c8a050 → #b89040): the jazz tradition, fuzz organ
    warmth, pub lighting. Similar to jazz rock's amber but warmer
    and more organic — less "amplified" and more "acoustic."
  Olive-gold (#a09038): Canterbury's unique colour — the green
    undertone of English pastoral meeting the gold of jazz warmth.
    No other genre in the system uses this specific tone.
  Soft cream (#d8c898): the lighter passages, the moments of
    delicacy between complex sections.
  Muted rose (#b08068): the humour — warm, slightly flushed,
    like a blush of amusement. Appears on the side-excursion
    detour lines.

    THE MEANDERING PATH
    ═══════════════════
    A primary line that flows across the canvas with gentle, amused
    curves — wider arcs than post bop's angular bends, looser than
    baroque pop's melodic precision. The line WANDERS: it meanders
    with purpose but without urgency, like a walk through
    the English countryside where the destination matters less
    than the journey.

    CRITICAL TONE DISTINCTION from other line forms:
    - Post Bop axis: angular, intellectual, PURPOSEFUL
    - Baroque Pop flourish: flowing, ornamental, GRAND
    - Chamber Pop lattice: delicate, transparent, INTIMATE
    - Avant Prog polygon: rigid, asymmetric, CONFRONTATIONAL
    - Canterbury path: meandering, warm, AMUSED

    The path has 4 SIDE-EXCURSIONS — small branching loops that
    depart from the main line, explore briefly, and return.
    These are the genre's trademark: jazz solos, humorous asides,
    genre pastiches that always circle back to the main theme.

    SIDE-EXCURSIONS — the Canterbury detours
    ═══════════════════
    4 small branching loops that depart from the main path,
    explore briefly, and return. Each represents a different
    kind of Canterbury digression:

    1. JAZZ SOLO — a longer, more elaborate detour upward
       (the musicians stretching out over changes)
    2. HUMOROUS ASIDE — a quick downward loop
       (a silly voice, a kazoo, a music-hall quote)
    3. GENRE PASTICHE — a medium detour with a different character
       (suddenly playing country, or classical, or music hall)
    4. GENTLE RETURN — a small reflective curl
       (a quiet moment before the next section)

    Detour colour: muted rose (#b08068) — the blush of amusement,
    warmer and pinker than the main path's amber-olive.
    The detours have a DIFFERENT COLOUR than the main path because
    they represent DEPARTURES from the main compositional thread.
