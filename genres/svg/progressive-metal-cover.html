  PROGRESSIVE METAL — Playlist Cover #159
  Design System: Playlist Cover v1

  SONIC DNA ANALYSIS:
  ═══════════════════
  Progressive Metal's defining sonic features:
  1. ARCHITECTURAL COMPLEXITY — the defining distinction from
     progressive death metal. Both are complex. Both use odd
     time signatures. Both have extended compositions. But
     prog death's complexity is JAGGED and VIOLENT (zigzag,
     hard cuts, angular unpredictability). Progressive metal's
     complexity is ARCHITECTURAL and GRAND (interlocking parts,
     calculated intersections, structural engineering). Prog
     death is a seismograph; prog metal is a blueprint.
  2. INTERLOCKING POLYRHYTHM — where prog death uses odd time
     signatures for DISRUPTION (the unexpected downbeat),
     progressive metal uses them for CONSTRUCTION. A 7/8 guitar
     riff interlocks with a 4/4 drum pattern — they diverge,
     creating tension, then REALIGN every 28 beats in a
     satisfying resolution. The polyrhythm is ENGINEERING —
     calculated, intentional, designed to create and resolve
     structural tension. Tool's "Lateralus" uses Fibonacci
     sequence as rhythmic architecture.
  3. THE GRAND FORM — extended compositions (10-25 minutes)
     structured as ARCHITECTURAL WHOLES. Not through-composed
     rambling (jam) or gradual transformation (progressive house)
     but DESIGNED structures with overtures, expositions,
     developments, recapitulations, codas. Dream Theater's
     "Octavarium" (24 min), Tool's "Disposition/Reflection/Triad"
     trilogy — compositions designed like buildings, where every
     room connects to every other room.
  4. VIRTUOSITY AS STRUCTURE — the technical playing serves
     the architecture. Dream Theater's Petrucci, Tool's Carey,
     Periphery's rhythm section — the virtuosity isn't display
     (shred) or necessary-execution (prog death) but STRUCTURAL
     MATERIAL. The complex part IS the composition, not a solo
     over a composition. The building's ornament is load-bearing.
  5. CLEAN + HEAVY DYNAMICS — like prog death, progressive metal
     moves between clean and heavy. But the transitions are
     COMPOSED — there's often a clear formal logic to which
     sections are clean and which are heavy, like the movement
     structure of a symphony. The heaviness arrives when the
     structure demands it, not as a surprise.
  6. PRODUCTION CLARITY — progressive metal is typically well-
     produced with HIGH CLARITY. Every interlocking part needs
     to be audible. The polyrhythmic architecture collapses if
     you can't hear how the parts fit together. This is NOT the
     deliberately rough production of black metal or the lo-fi
     charm of indie — it's ENGINEERING-GRADE clarity.

  VISUAL TRANSLATION:
  ═══════════════════
  Background: Deep blue-steel (#080a10) — darker and cooler
    than progressive house's midnight blue, with a strong steel
    quality. The cold precision of architectural design, the
    blue-shift of complex engineering. Not warm (not organic),
    not purple (not as intellectually violet as prog death).
    Steel blue: the colour of precision.
  Central form: THE INTERLOCKING STRUCTURE — a geometric form
    composed of precisely angled line segments that MEET AT
    CALCULATED INTERSECTIONS, creating an architectural whole.
    Unlike prog death's zigzag (which is a single path that
    turns violently), prog metal's form has MULTIPLE PATHS
    that intersect — two or three angular trajectories that
    cross at engineered points, like the ribs of a vaulted
    ceiling meeting at keystones.
    The intersections are the POLYRHYTHMIC ALIGNMENT POINTS —
    the moments where divergent time signatures realign, where
    the 7/8 and 4/4 meet every 28 beats. The structure between
    intersections represents the DIVERGENCE — the parts moving
    apart in calculated tension.
    COMPARISON:
    - Prog Death fractured path: ONE path, zigzagging violently
      (single composed line of angular violence)
    - Prog Metal interlocking structure: MULTIPLE paths meeting
      at intersection points (architectural engineering)
    - Avant Prog diagonals-in-frame: structured asymmetry within
      boundaries (chamber composition)
  Glow: Cold steel (0.03) — the cold precision of a well-lit
    engineering space. Minimal but present — the blueprint needs
    light to be read.
  Grain: 18% — MODERATE. Clean production but with the weight
    of metal distortion. Lower than prog death (26%) because
    progressive metal prioritizes CLARITY (the interlocking
    parts need to be distinguishable). Higher than progressive
    house (14%) because metal's distorted guitars add texture.
  Displacement: scale=2 — moderate. The polyrhythmic tension
    warps the rhythmic grid, but in a CONTROLLED way. Not the
    wild warping of prog death (3) — a calculated displacement,
    like engineered flex in a bridge.
  Blur: stdDev=2 — LOW. Sharp, clear, every part audible. The
    engineering-grade clarity that progressive metal production
    demands. Same as prog death but for a different reason:
    prog death is sharp for PRECISION; prog metal is sharp for
    ARCHITECTURAL LEGIBILITY.
  Particles: 3 motes — the moments of resolution, the
    INTERSECTION POINTS where divergent elements realign. Three
    cool-toned motes at the intersection points of the structure.
    Not warmth (not emotional beauty) but STRUCTURAL SATISFACTION
    — the pleasure of parts fitting together.
  BPM: ~130 BPM → 17 ticks at 17px, POLYRHYTHMIC ACCENT.
    TWO accent layers superimposed: primary accents every 4 ticks
    (the 4/4 grid) + secondary accents every 3 ticks (the 3/4 or
    7/8 cross-rhythm). Where they COINCIDE = strongest accent
    (the realignment point). First POLYRHYTHMIC BPM strip.

  FAMILY PLACEMENT:
  ═══════════════════
  Progressive Rock → Progressive Metal (the heavy elaboration)
  Metal → Progressive Metal (the compositional ambition)

  Progressive Metal sits BETWEEN:
  - Progressive Rock (complex but acoustic/lighter)
  - Progressive Death Metal (complex but jagged/heavier)

  It shares prog rock's architectural ambition and prog death's
  heaviness, but occupies a middle ground: more structured than
  prog death, heavier than prog rock.

  Connects to:
  - Avant Prog: shares the grand compositional ambition but
    avant prog is ACOUSTIC/CHAMBER scale; prog metal is
    AMPLIFIED/ARENA scale
  - Dream Theater → Tool → Periphery evolution: from
    symphonic architecture → spiritual architecture →
    polyrhythmic architecture
  Key artists: Dream Theater, Tool, Mastodon, Haken,
    Porcupine Tree, Leprous, TesseracT, Periphery,
    Caligula's Horse, Pain of Salvation

  COLOUR RATIONALE:
  ═══════════════════
  Deep blue-steel (#080a10): precision, engineering, cold clarity
  Cool steel-blue (#7888a8 → #6878a0 → #8898b0): the
    architectural lines — cold, precise, blue-shifted. Bluer
    than prog death's violet-steel (which has compositional
    purple). The blue says ENGINEERING where the violet says
    INTELLECT. Both are cold; the temperature is different.
  Bright steel-white (#a8b0c0): the intersection points —
    brightest where the parts align, where the polyrhythm
    resolves, where the architecture demonstrates its
    structural integrity.
  Faint warm accent (#a09070): the barest suggestion of the
    human within the machine — the emotional weight that makes
    progressive metal more than technical exercise.

    THE INTERLOCKING STRUCTURE
    ═══════════════════
    TWO angular trajectories that cross at calculated
    intersection points — the ribs of a vaulted ceiling.

    PATH A: "The 4/4 Architecture"
    The primary rhythmic/compositional trajectory. Angular
    but with a sense of FORWARD PROGRESS and structural logic.
    Heavier strokes — the main riff architecture.

    PATH B: "The Cross-Rhythm"
    The secondary trajectory, starting from a different position,
    crossing Path A at THREE calculated intersection points.
    Represents the polyrhythmic counterpoint, the 7/8 or 3/4
    that weaves against the primary structure.

    Where the paths CROSS = polyrhythmic realignment = the
    brightest, most structurally satisfying moments.

    Unlike prog death's single zigzag path, this form is
    MULTI-TRAJECTORY — two independent compositional lines
    that interact architecturally.
