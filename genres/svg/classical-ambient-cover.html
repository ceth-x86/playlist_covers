  CLASSICAL AMBIENT — Playlist Cover #150
  Design System: Playlist Cover v1

  SONIC DNA ANALYSIS:
  ═══════════════════
  Classical Ambient's defining sonic features:
  1. THE SUSTAINED TONE — the fundamental unit. A piano note
     with the sustain pedal held open. A cello bowed pianissimo
     on an open string. A violin harmonic held until the bow
     runs out. Classical ambient takes the single instrumental
     TONE and makes it the entire composition. Not the note within
     a melody — the note AS the experience. The attack, the sustain,
     the slow decay, the sympathetic resonances, the room.
  2. CLASSICAL INSTRUMENTS, FREED — piano, strings, occasionally
     brass or woodwind, but freed from classical STRUCTURE. No
     sonata form, no development, no recapitulation, no resolution.
     The instruments carry all their timbral richness and emotional
     weight but none of their structural obligations. A cello
     doesn't need to go anywhere. It can simply BE.
  3. THE DECAY — where industrial ambient focuses on the space
     (reverb, architecture), classical ambient focuses on the
     DECAY of the note itself. The way a piano string vibrates
     after being struck — the fundamental fading, the upper
     partials lingering, the sympathetic strings responding,
     the whole instrument resonating and slowly falling silent.
     The decay IS the composition. William Basinski's Disintegration
     Loops: literally the sound of tape decay.
  4. PROCESSING AS PRESERVATION — tape loops, digital delay, subtle
     reverb applied not to transform (industrial) or to alienate
     (psytrance) but to PRESERVE — to extend the note's natural
     life, to hold the resonance in amber, to keep the decay
     from reaching silence. The processing is an act of care.
  5. EMOTIONAL LUMINOSITY — classical ambient is emotionally
     CLEAR in a way that dark ambient and industrial ambient
     are not. The emotions are gentle: tenderness, melancholy,
     beauty, acceptance, the bittersweetness of time passing.
     Not the ecstasy of trance or the despair of grunge or the
     alienation of industrial. Quiet, present, luminous sadness.
  6. SILENCE AS PARTNER — the spaces between notes are as
     composed as the notes themselves. Classical ambient embraces
     silence not as absence (industrial ambient's void) but as
     REST — the silence is breathing, is patient, is comfortable.
     Silence is not emptiness; silence is the room listening.

  VISUAL TRANSLATION:
  ═══════════════════
  Background: Warm deep grey (#0a0908) — the warmest dark in
    the ambient family. Not cold concrete (industrial ambient)
    or pure black (drone). The darkness of a recital hall after
    the audience has left — the velvet seats, the wooden stage,
    the warm acoustic space still holding the resonance of what
    was played.
  Central form: THE FADING TONE — a single horizontal line
    spanning nearly the full canvas width, representing one
    sustained note. The line is brightest at the left (the
    attack, the moment the string is bowed or the key struck)
    and fades gradually to the right (the decay, the resonance
    slowly diminishing). The line never quite reaches zero
    opacity on the right — the decay continues beyond the
    edge of the canvas, the note never fully dies.
    Above the primary line, 2-3 extremely faint shorter lines
    represent UPPER PARTIALS — the harmonic overtones that
    linger after the fundamental begins to fade. These are
    thinner, higher-positioned, and fade faster than the
    fundamental, encoding the physics of acoustic decay.
    Below, a slightly broader, even fainter presence represents
    SYMPATHETIC RESONANCE — other strings vibrating in response,
    the instrument's body resonating, the room answering.
    This is the most MINIMAL central form in the system —
    a single line with its harmonic shadows. Maximum emotional
    content in minimum visual material.
  Glow: Warm luminous (0.04) — gentle, the warmth of wood and
    felt. More than industrial ambient (0.015) because classical
    ambient has emotional warmth. Less than spiritual jazz (0.09)
    because classical ambient's warmth is quiet, not radiant.
    The glow of a piano's lacquered surface catching dim light.
  Grain: 14% — low-moderate. Classical ambient is carefully
    recorded — good microphones, good rooms, attention to acoustic
    detail. The grain represents tape hiss from the processing
    chain (Basinski's loops, Richter's tape treatments), not
    production limitation.
  Displacement: scale=0 — ZERO. The tone is pure. The instrument
    is in tune. The note is allowed to exist exactly as it was
    produced. No warping, no processing distortion, no alteration
    of the fundamental sound. Processing PRESERVES; it doesn't
    TRANSFORM.
  Blur: stdDev=7 — HIGH. The sustain pedal's wash, the room's
    natural reverb, the tape loop's gentle diffusion. Industrial
    ambient's blur (9) is the reverb of vast concrete; classical
    ambient's blur (7) is the reverb of an intimate wooden room.
    Both are high but encode different spaces — one is cavernous
    and empty, the other is warm and resonant.
  Particles: 2 motes — extremely gentle, warm. Upper partials
    that have separated from the fundamental and float
    independently. The harmonics you hear after the attack has
    faded: the octave, the fifth, the ghost notes of a piano
    string's complex vibration.
  BPM: NO BPM STRIP — the second genre with no rhythm encoding.
    Like industrial ambient, classical ambient exists outside
    musical time. But the reason is different: industrial ambient
    has no pulse because the machines have stopped; classical
    ambient has no pulse because the MUSIC has slowed to the pace
    of breathing, of resonance, of natural acoustic decay.

  FAMILY PLACEMENT:
  ═══════════════════
  Ambient family:
  Ambient → (branches into):
    - Dark Ambient (cold, cosmic, void)
    - Industrial Ambient (architectural, decayed, concrete)
    - Classical Ambient (warm, luminous, acoustic decay)
  Classical music lineage:
  Classical → Modern Classical → Minimalism → Classical Ambient
  Classical Ambient sits at the intersection of:
  - Minimalism (Reich, Glass, Riley): shares the repetition and
    patience but classical ambient is even MORE reduced — not
    repeating patterns but sustained single tones
  - ECM Records aesthetic: shares the space, clarity, and
    emotional luminosity. Keith Jarrett's quieter moments,
    Arvo Pärt's tintinnabuli
  Connects to:
  - Industrial Ambient: both occupy the ambient space without
    rhythm, but industrial ambient frames ABSENCE (the void);
    classical ambient frames PRESENCE (the tone, still sounding)
  - Chamber Pop: shares the acoustic instruments and intimacy,
    but chamber pop is COMPOSED (songs with structure); classical
    ambient is SUSTAINED (tones without structure)
  - Spiritual Jazz: shares the devotional patience and sustained
    tones (tambura drone ≈ cello drone), but spiritual jazz
    ASCENDS to ecstasy; classical ambient RESTS in quiet beauty
  Key artists: Max Richter, Nils Frahm, Ólafur Arnalds,
    Stars of the Lid, A Winged Victory for the Sullen,
    Jóhann Jóhannsson, Hildur Guðnadóttir, William Basinski,
    Harold Budd, Grouper (ambient works)

  COLOUR RATIONALE:
  ═══════════════════
  Warm deep grey (#0a0908): recital hall after hours
  Warm ivory (#d0c0a0 → #c0b090 → #a89878): the colour of
    piano keys, of aged paper, of lacquered wood, of rosin
    dust. The warmest, most organic tone in the ambient family.
    Where industrial ambient uses oxidized grey (metal) and dark
    ambient uses deep blue-black (void), classical ambient uses
    IVORY — the colour of the instrument itself.
  Soft amber (#b8a480): the sympathetic resonance colour — a
    deeper, warmer tone representing the instrument's body
    vibrating in response. The wood of the piano, the varnish
    of the cello.
  The palette is narrow and warm — entirely within the
    ivory/amber range. No cool tones, no blue, no grey. Pure
    acoustic warmth. The visual equivalent of felt hammers
    striking steel strings inside a wooden box.

  <!--
    THE FADING TONE
    ═══════════════════
    The most minimal central form in the entire 150-cover system.
    A single horizontal line representing one sustained note,
    brightest at the attack (left) and fading across the canvas
    as the note decays. Never quite reaching zero — the resonance
    continues beyond the edge.

    This is the visual encoding of ACOUSTIC DECAY — the physics
    of a vibrating string gradually losing energy, the complex
    interplay of fundamental and overtones as the sound
    diminishes toward silence.

    THREE LAYERS of acoustic physics:
    1. FUNDAMENTAL (main line): the primary pitch, strongest
       and longest-lasting
    2. UPPER PARTIALS (thinner lines above): overtones that
       fade faster than the fundamental
    3. SYMPATHETIC RESONANCE (broader presence below): other
       strings and the instrument body responding

    Compare to other horizontal forms:
    - Pop Rock waveform: symmetric oscillation (active sound)
    - Grunge sag: weighted droop (exhausted sound)
    - Schranz wall: dense band of impacts (compressed sound)
    - Classical Ambient tone: single fading line (DYING sound)
      The most patient, most quiet, most gentle form.
  -->

  <!--
    SYMPATHETIC RESONANCE — the instrument body responding
    Broader, fainter, warmer than the fundamental.
    Delayed onset (doesn't start at x=0) because sympathetic
    vibration takes a moment to develop after the attack.

    HARMONIC MOTES — 2 particles

    Upper partials that have separated from the fundamental

    attack has faded: the octave shimmer, the fifth's ghost,
    the overtones that linger in the sustain pedal's wash.

    Warm, extremely gentle. Positioned in the left-centre
    where the fundamental is still bright enough to generate
    visible harmonics.

    NO BPM STRIP.
    The second genre with no rhythm. But different from
    industrial ambient's reason: industrial has no pulse
    because the machines have STOPPED. Classical ambient has
    no pulse because the music has slowed to the pace of
    BREATHING, of RESONANCE, of natural acoustic decay.
    One is absence by cessation; the other is absence by
    transcendence of tempo.
