  POP ROCK — Playlist Cover
  Design System: Playlist Cover v1

  SONIC DNA ANALYSIS:
  ═══════════════════
  Pop Rock's defining sonic features:
  1. THE CENTRE — pop rock is the gravitational centre of
     Western popular music. It's where pop's melodic accessibility
     and rock's instrumental energy overlap perfectly. Not pushing
     toward any extreme: not heavy, not minimal, not experimental,
     not avant-garde. It IS the mainstream, and that's not a
     criticism — it's an achievement of balance.
  2. THE HOOK — the memorable melodic phrase that defines the song.
     Pop rock lives and dies by the hook: the guitar riff, the
     chorus melody, the singalong moment. Where avant prog refuses
     hooks and spiritual jazz transcends them, pop rock PERFECTS them.
  3. BAND INSTRUMENTATION + POP STRUCTURE — electric guitar, bass,
     drums, keyboards in verse-chorus-verse-bridge-chorus format.
     Neither the complexity of prog nor the simplicity of punk.
     The arrangement serves the song, not the other way around.
  4. RADIO-FRIENDLY DYNAMICS — consistent energy, moderate tempo,
     compressed dynamic range. The song sounds good at any volume,
     on any system, in any context. Engineered for universality.
  5. CLARITY OF EMOTION — the lyrics are direct, the melodies are
     singable, the emotion is LEGIBLE. Joy, heartbreak, yearning,
     celebration — expressed clearly, not obscured by abstraction.
  6. PRODUCTION POLISH — clean, bright, present. The guitar is
     distorted but controlled. The vocals are up front. The mix is
     balanced. Professional craftsmanship applied to emotional
     directness.

  VISUAL TRANSLATION:
  ═══════════════════
  Background: Clean dark blue-grey (#0a0c10) — neutral, professional,
    neither warm (jazz, house) nor cold (industrial, techno). The
    background that would work on ANY album cover. Pop rock's visual
    identity is about being ACCESSIBLE, not distinctive.
  Central form: THE CLEAN WAVEFORM — a single symmetric, smooth sine-like
    wave, centered and balanced. This is the most LEGIBLE form in
    the system — immediately readable, universally understood.
    NOT angular (post bop, avant prog), NOT ornate (baroque pop),
    NOT fragmented (power noise), NOT vertical (spiritual jazz).
    Just a WAVE — the most fundamental representation of sound,
    clean and direct. Slightly wider/taller than a pure sine wave
    to convey rock energy, but still fundamentally SMOOTH and
    SYMMETRIC.
    The wave represents:
    - The guitar riff's melodic contour
    - The song's verse-chorus dynamic arc
    - The universal waveform — sound itself, unpretentious
  Glow: Balanced warm-neutral (0.06) — present but not characterful.
    The stage lighting of a well-produced arena show: bright,
    professional, flattering.
  Grain: 12% — the LOWEST grain tier in the system (tied with
    dream pop, dance pop, cool jazz). Pop rock is the most polished
    mainstream genre. Clean production is foundational.
  Displacement: scale=0 — ZERO. Pop rock is direct, unwarped,
    unprocessed. What you hear is what it is. No distortion of
    the signal, no conceptual warping.
  Blur: stdDev=3 — moderate, professional. The reverb of a
    well-treated studio. Not dry (punk) and not washed (shoegaze).
    Just right.
  Particles: 3 motes — minimal but present. The hook sparkle,
    the chorus shimmer, the bridge lift. Not abundant (this isn't
    baroque pop's orchestral detail) but not zero (pop rock isn't
    austere). Three reliable, well-placed details.
  BPM: ~120 BPM → 17 ticks at 18px, kick weight 0.45px (moderate,
    even). PERFECTLY EVEN spacing, alternating kick-hat with no
    surprises. The most predictable, reliable, SOLID rhythm in
    this session. Pop rock's beat is a FOUNDATION, not a feature.

  FAMILY PLACEMENT:
  ═══════════════════
  Pop Rock sits at the CENTRE of multiple family trees:
  - Classic Rock → Pop Rock (rock simplified for accessibility)
  - Pop → Pop Rock (pop energized with band instrumentation)
  It's the convergence point. From pop rock, genres DIVERGE:
  - Toward complexity: Art Rock, Prog Rock
  - Toward aggression: Punk, Hard Rock, Metal
  - Toward introspection: Indie Rock, Alternative
  - Toward polish: Power Pop, Synthpop
  - Toward simplicity: Bubblegum, Teen Pop
  Pop Rock is the trunk; other genres are branches.
  Connects to:
  - Power Pop: pop rock with more jangle, more hooks
  - Soft Rock: pop rock with less energy, more ballad
  - Heartland Rock: pop rock with more sincerity, more Americana
  Key artists: Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, Bryan Adams, Sheryl Crow,
    Matchbox Twenty, Kelly Clarkson, Maroon 5, Avril Lavigne,
    Foo Fighters (accessible moments), Paramore

  COLOUR RATIONALE:
  ═══════════════════
  Clean dark blue-grey (#0a0c10): neutral professionalism
  Warm white-gold (#d8c8a0 → #c8b890): the colour of a spotlight
    on a performer — warm, flattering, universal. Not the specific
    amber of jazz or the specific gold of house. A GENERAL warm
    light that works on any stage.
  Clean white (#e8e0d0): brightness, clarity, the hook's
    crystalline quality. Pop rock's emotional clarity rendered
    as visual clarity.
  The palette is deliberately UNREMARKABLE — not unique, not
    distinctive, not signature. Pop rock's visual identity is
    ACCESSIBILITY. It could be anything. That's the point.
    The centre doesn't need to distinguish itself from the edges.

    THE CLEAN WAVEFORM
    ═══════════════════
    A single, symmetric, smooth wave — the most LEGIBLE,
    most DIRECT, most UNIVERSAL form in the entire system.

    This is the visual centre, just as pop rock is the musical centre.
    Every other genre's form can be understood as a DEPARTURE from
    this baseline:
    - Post Bop bends it (angular structure)
    - Baroque Pop ornaments it (decorative elaboration)
    - Avant Prog fractures it (radical deconstruction)
    - Spiritual Jazz rotates it vertical (transcendent ascent)
    - Power Noise fills it with texture (noise as material)
    - Canterbury lets it wander (whimsical detours)

    Pop Rock's waveform IS the wave before modification.
    The fundamental. The default. The centre.

    Two full cycles of a smooth wave, symmetric around the
    horizontal centre (y=220). Clean Bezier curves with
    matching peaks and troughs.

  <!--
    THE WAVE — two complete cycles
    Smooth, symmetric, balanced. Peak amplitude ≈ ±35px from centre.
    Not a huge dynamic range (that would be prog), not flat
    (that would be ambient). Moderate, controlled energy.

  BPM STRIP — ~120 BPM, PERFECTLY EVEN
  ═══════════════════
  17 ticks at 18px, kick weight 0.45px (moderate, solid).
  PERFECTLY EVEN spacing, consistent alternating kick-hat.
  No swing (not jazz/garage), no asymmetry (not avant prog),
  no displaced accents (not post bop), no triplets (not trap),
  no uniform wall (not frenchcore).

  This is the BASELINE rhythm — the beat that everything else
  is a variation of. Every other BPM strip in the system can be
  understood as a departure from this standard pattern:
  - UK Garage swings it
  - Jazz Rock groups it asymmetrically
  - Avant Prog makes every gap different
  - Frenchcore removes all variation
  - Post Bop displaces the accents

  Pop Rock's strip is the DEFAULT. The centre. The reference.

  Starting x = (600 - 16*18) / 2 = 156
