  PROGRESSIVE DEATH METAL — Playlist Cover #158
  Design System: Playlist Cover v1

  SONIC DNA ANALYSIS:
  ═══════════════════
  Progressive Death Metal's defining sonic features:
  1. ANGULAR COMPLEXITY — the defining quality. Where progressive
     house transitions GRADUALLY between states, progressive death
     metal LEAPS. The time signature changes from 4/4 to 7/8 to
     5/4 within a single phrase. The key shifts without modulation.
     The texture flips from clean arpeggios to blast-beat brutality
     mid-bar. Every transition is ABRUPT, ANGULAR, and UNPREDICTABLE.
     The compositional surface is JAGGED — no smooth curves, no
     gradual fades, no gentle modulation. Sharp angles, hard cuts,
     sudden transformations.
  2. ODD TIME SIGNATURES — the rhythmic foundation. 7/8, 11/8, 5/4,
     13/16, alternating bars of different meters. The listener cannot
     predict where the next downbeat falls. The rhythmic complexity
     serves the angular aesthetic: just as the melody is angular,
     the RHYTHM is angular — asymmetric, off-balance, deliberately
     uncomfortable.
  3. BEAUTY WITHIN BRUTALITY — the emotional range. A passage of
     clean guitar arpeggios (Opeth), a jazz chord voicing (Cynic),
     a classical piano interlude (Ne Obliviscaris), followed by a
     blast-beat section with death growls. The juxtaposition is
     deliberate and unresolved — the beauty doesn't "lead to" the
     brutality or vice versa. They COEXIST, alternating, neither
     dominant. This is different from atmospheric black metal's
     gradual interplay — prog death's transitions are HARD CUTS.
  4. EXTENDED COMPOSITION — 8-15 minute songs structured more like
     classical movements than rock songs. Theme A, development,
     Theme B, recapitulation, bridge to new material, recapitulation
     of transformed Theme A. The compositional ambition is EXPLICIT —
     these are composed, not improvised (unlike jazz) or generated
     (unlike ambient). Every angular turn is WRITTEN.
  5. TECHNICAL VIRTUOSITY — the playing is demanding. Complex
     guitar patterns that require precision at high speed, drum
     patterns that shift meter every few bars, bass lines that
     move independently of the guitar. The virtuosity serves the
     composition — it's not display (like shred guitar) but
     NECESSARY to execute the angular vision.
  6. DEATH METAL'S WEIGHT — despite the compositional complexity,
     the WEIGHT of death metal is retained. The tuning is low
     (drop-B, drop-A). The distortion is heavy. The growled
     vocals are guttural. The blast beats are ferocious. This
     isn't "metal-lite" or fusion — it's DEATH METAL that happens
     to be composed with the ambition of chamber music.

  VISUAL TRANSLATION:
  ═══════════════════
  Background: Deep cold dark (#080608) — darker than grunge,
    cooler than EBM. The darkness of death metal's aesthetic,
    with a slight purple-cold quality suggesting the compositional
    sophistication lurking within the heaviness.
  Central form: THE FRACTURED PATH — a connected series of line
    segments at SHARP ANGLES, creating a jagged, unpredictable
    path across the canvas. No two consecutive segments have the
    same angle. No segment is horizontal (that would be rest)
    or smoothly curved (that would be gradual). Every turn is
    ABRUPT — the visual equivalent of a time signature change.
    The path moves generally left-to-right (time progresses)
    but ascends and descends UNPREDICTABLY — encoding the
    dynamic range from clean quiet passages (lower positions)
    to blast-beat ferocity (higher positions/thicker segments).
    VARYING THICKNESS along the path: thicker segments = heavy
    riffs (death metal weight), thinner segments = clean/quiet
    passages (beauty within brutality). The thickness changes
    are ABRUPT, not gradual — hard cuts between states.
    COMPARISON TO OTHER ANGULAR/IRREGULAR FORMS:
    - Post Bop: angular but CURVED (bent line with sudden
      direction changes — jazz's angular improvisation)
    - Avant Prog: angular but STRUCTURED (internal diagonals
      within a geometric frame — composed asymmetry)
    - Progressive Death Metal: angular and JAGGED (connected
      segments at sharp angles — compositional violence)
    Post bop BENDS. Avant prog FRACTURES within structure.
    Prog death ZIGZAGS — raw directional violence.
  Glow: Near-zero (0.025) — cold, dark. The stage lighting
    at a prog death show: minimal, unflattering, functional.
    Not atmospheric (progressive house) or absent (schranz).
    Just enough light to see the fretboard.
  Grain: 26% — HIGH. The heavy guitar distortion, the density
    of the mix, the lo-mid heaviness of death metal production.
    Higher than atmospheric black metal (24%) because prog death
    is more rhythmically aggressive, more densely textured.
  Displacement: scale=3 — HIGH. The rhythmic displacement of
    odd time signatures, the unpredictable shifts in meter and
    key. The composition itself is displaced from expectation.
    Matching psychedelic rock's displacement but encoding
    COMPOSITIONAL warping rather than PERCEPTUAL warping.
  Blur: stdDev=2 — LOW. Sharp, precise, immediate. The
    technical precision required to execute odd-time passages
    at high speed. Every note is intentional, every transition
    is composed. The clarity of a well-produced death metal
    album where you can hear every instrument despite the
    density.
  Particles: 2 motes — the beauty within the brutality.
    Clean guitar harmonics, piano interludes, the moments of
    unexpected tenderness. Sparse because these moments are
    RARE — brief clearings in the angular forest. One warm
    (the clean passage), one cool (the jazz-influenced harmony).
  BPM: IRREGULAR — the first BPM strip with VARYING SPACING.
    Average ~135 BPM but the tick spacing is UNEVEN, encoding
    the odd time signatures. Groups of ticks at different
    intervals: 3+3+2, 4+3, 2+3+2+2 — the visual representation
    of alternating time signatures. The first rhythmically
    ASYMMETRIC BPM strip in the system.

  FAMILY PLACEMENT:
  ═══════════════════
  Death Metal → Progressive Death Metal (the compositional wing)
  Also: Progressive Rock → (heavied) → Progressive Metal →
    Progressive Death Metal

  The "progressive" label means DIFFERENT THINGS in different
  contexts:
  - Progressive House: gradual transformation (smoothness)
  - Progressive Rock: compositional ambition (complexity)
  - Progressive Death Metal: angular complexity + death weight
    (violence + ambition)

  Connects to:
  - Avant Prog: shares the asymmetric composition and
    time-signature complexity but avant prog is ACOUSTIC/CHAMBER;
    prog death is HEAVY/ELECTRIC.
  - Post Bop: shares the angular, unpredictable movement and
    jazz-influenced harmony. Cynic and Atheist explicitly draw
    from jazz.
  - Atmospheric Black Metal: both are metal subgenres that
    transcend their parent genre's limitations, but atmospheric
    black metal transcends through LANDSCAPE (horizontal);
    prog death transcends through COMPOSITION (angular).
  Key artists: Opeth, Death (Human through Sound of
    Perseverance), Cynic, Atheist, Gojira, Between the Buried
    and Me, Ne Obliviscaris, Rivers of Nihil, Persefone

  COLOUR RATIONALE:
  ═══════════════════
  Deep cold dark (#080608): death metal darkness with
    compositional sophistication
  Cold steel-violet (#8878a0 → #7868a0 → #9888a8): the colour
    of the angular path — not pure grey (too neutral) or warm
    (too gentle) or bright (too energetic). Steel-violet: cold,
    sophisticated, heavy. The purple undertone acknowledges
    the compositional ambition; the steel quality retains
    death metal's weight.
  Bright steel (#b0a8b8): the thickest segments — the death
    metal riff at full force, the blast beat section, the
    heaviest moments. Brighter because these moments are
    LOUDER, more present.
  Warm amber (#c0a070): the clean passage mote — the
    unexpected beauty, the moment of warmth within the cold
    angular structure.
  Cool blue-grey (#7080a0): the jazz-harmony mote — the
    intellectual/harmonic sophistication that lifts prog death
    above pure aggression.

    THE FRACTURED PATH
    ═══════════════════
    Connected line segments at sharp angles — no two consecutive
    segments at the same angle. The path progresses generally
    left-to-right (time) but ascends and descends unpredictably
    (dynamics/intensity).

    VARYING STROKE WIDTH encodes the brutality spectrum:
    THICK (2.0-2.5px) = heavy riff, blast beat, growled vocal
    THIN (0.7-1.0px) = clean passage, arpeggio, quiet interlude
    The width changes are ABRUPT — hard cuts, not gradual
    transitions. This distinguishes prog death from progressive
    house (gradual) and from atmospheric black metal (gradual
    interplay).

    12 segments encoding a composition's journey through
    contrasting sections. The path is a SCORE — each segment
    is a section, each angle change is a time signature shift,
    each width change is a dynamic hard cut.

    COMPARISON:
    Post Bop: one continuous BENT line (improvised curves)
    Avant Prog: internal DIAGONALS within a frame (structured)
    Prog Death: connected ZIGZAG (composed violence)

  BPM STRIP — ~135 BPM average, IRREGULAR SPACING
  ═══════════════════
  The FIRST rhythmically ASYMMETRIC BPM strip in the system.

  Instead of even spacing, ticks are grouped to encode odd
  time signatures: groups of 3+3+2, 4+3, 2+3+2 — the
  visual representation of alternating meters.

  Within each group, spacing is 14px (tight).
  Between groups, spacing is 22px (gap = barline).

  Kick weight 0.5px (solid, heavy — death metal's weight).
  Every tick the same weight but at UNEVEN intervals.

  This is the opposite of every other BPM strip:
  - Pop rock: perfectly even (baseline normalcy)
  - Progressive house: perfectly even (anchor constancy)
  - Grunge: mostly even with two drags (reluctance)
  - Psytrance: grouped by 4 (squelch pattern)
  - EBM: alternating heavy/light (march)
  - Prog Death: IRREGULAR groups (odd time signatures)
