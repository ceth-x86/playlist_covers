  SYNTHWAVE — Playlist Cover
  Design System: Playlist Cover v1

  SONIC DNA ANALYSIS:
  ═══════════════════
  Synthwave's defining sonic features:
  1. RETRO-FUTURISM — the defining concept. Synthwave doesn't recreate
     the 80s; it creates the 80s AS REMEMBERED — an idealized, neon-lit,
     chrome-plated version of a decade filtered through VHS nostalgia
     and cinematic imagination. The music sounds like a memory of a
     future that never happened. It's nostalgia for something that
     never existed.
  2. THE ARPEGGIATOR — relentless, driving arpeggiated synth patterns
     are synthwave's rhythmic backbone. Sequenced sixteenth-note
     arpeggios on analog-modeled synths (Juno, Jupiter, OB-X emulations)
     create the genre's kinetic, forward-driving energy. The arpeggiator
     is the engine; the song is the vehicle.
  3. CINEMATIC SCOPE — synthwave sounds HUGE. Massive reverb spaces,
     wide stereo imaging, layered pads that fill every frequency.
     The music is designed to feel like a movie soundtrack — not
     intimate (indie synthpop) but PANORAMIC. Vangelis's Blade Runner
     score is the spiritual ancestor.
  4. GATED REVERB DRUMS — the Phil Collins/80s production signature,
     applied with intentional excess. The snare EXPLODES with gated
     reverb, the toms cascade like thunder. Not subtle; monumental.
  5. NEON PALETTE — synthwave's sonic and visual aesthetics are
     inseparable. The music SOUNDS like neon pink and electric blue.
     The colour palette isn't decorative; it's structural. The
     synth tones are chosen to evoke specific colours.
  6. DRIVING VELOCITY — synthwave moves FORWARD relentlessly. Unlike
     ambient (stationary), house (cyclical), or jazz (exploratory),
     synthwave has a destination. The highway stretches to the
     horizon. The car accelerates. The city grows on the horizon.

  VISUAL TRANSLATION:
  ═══════════════════
  Background: Deep electric blue-black (#060a18) — the night sky
    in a synthwave music video. Deeper blue than indie synthpop's
    warm navy, cooler, more cinematic. The void through which the
    neon grid recedes.
  Central form: THE PERSPECTIVE GRID — converging lines receding
    to a vanishing point at the centre-top of the canvas. This is
    the iconic synthwave visual: the infinite neon grid stretching
    toward a horizon, the Tron landscape, the wireframe future.
    Horizontal lines space progressively closer as they approach
    the vanishing point (perspective foreshortening), while
    vertical lines converge toward the same point.
    This is the first PERSPECTIVE form in the system — the first
    form that encodes DEPTH and RECESSION into the visual space.
    Every other form exists on a flat plane; the synthwave grid
    recedes INTO the canvas.
  Glow: DUAL neon — hot pink/magenta at left (0.06) and
    electric cyan at right (0.05). The two-tone neon wash of
    synthwave's signature palette. Not warm gold (jazz/house)
    or cold silver (avant prog). NEON — artificial, deliberate,
    retro-futurist.
  Grain: 16% — moderate. Clean digital production with deliberate
    analog-modeling artifacts. Not truly lo-fi (indie synthpop's 22%)
    but not pristine either. The grain of a VHS dub — present but
    not dominant.
  Displacement: scale=0 — ZERO. Synthwave is precise, sequenced,
    machine-driven. The arpeggiator doesn't waver. The grid doesn't
    bend. The highway is straight. This music is about PRECISION
    in its retro-futurism.
  Blur: stdDev=3 — moderate, cinematic. The reverb of a huge
    synthetic space — the reverb tail of a gated snare, the wash
    of layered pads. Not diffuse (psychedelic) or intimate (chamber).
    Cinematic — like a movie shot with anamorphic lenses.
  Particles: 0 — ZERO. The grid IS the form. Synthwave's visual
    language is about GEOMETRY, not organic detail. No filigree,
    no motes, no sparkle. Just the grid, the convergence, the
    highway. The fourth zero-particle cover (after trap, power noise,
    avant prog), each encoding a different aesthetic of purity.
  BPM: ~128 BPM → 18 ticks at 16px, kick weight 0.5px (solid,
    driving). Even, relentless, mechanical. The arpeggiator's
    pulse: every tick identical, every gap equal. The highway
    markings passing at constant speed.

  FAMILY PLACEMENT:
  ═══════════════════
  Electronic lineage:
  Classic Synthpop (1980s original) → (time passes) → Synthwave (2000s revival)
  BUT synthwave is NOT a direct descendant — it's a NOSTALGIC
  RECONSTRUCTION. It doesn't continue synthpop's evolution; it
  REIMAGINES synthpop's aesthetic from a future vantage point.
  Connects to:
  - Classic Synthpop: the source material, but synthwave amplifies
    and idealizes what synthpop actually sounded like
  - Indie Synthpop: OPPOSITE approach to the same heritage.
    Indie synthpop makes synth music INTIMATE and lo-fi.
    Synthwave makes synth music CINEMATIC and polished.
  - Darksynth: synthwave's aggressive sibling (Perturbator,
    Carpenter Brut). Heavier, more distorted, horror-film aesthetic.
  - Outrun: synthwave's driving-focused subgenre, named after the
    Kavinsky album. All velocity, all highway.
  Key artists: Kavinsky, Perturbator, Carpenter Brut, Com Truise,
    FM-84, The Midnight, Gunship, Mitch Murder, Lazerhawk,
    Timecop1983, Electric Youth

  COLOUR RATIONALE:
  ═══════════════════
  Deep electric blue-black (#060a18): the cinematic night sky
  Hot pink/magenta (#e040a0 → #c03888): neon sign glow, the
    signature synthwave pink. This is NOT the warm rose of
    Canterbury or the muted lavender of indie synthpop. This is
    NEON — artificial, saturated, electric. The pink of a
    Miami Vice sunset, a neon sign reflected in wet asphalt.
  Electric cyan (#40c8e0 → #30a8c0): the cool complement —
    Tron grid blue, laser light, the other half of synthwave's
    two-tone neon palette. Together with the pink, these create
    the unmistakable synthwave chromatic identity.
  Chrome white (#d0d8e0): the grid lines — metallic, reflective,
    the wireframe future.
  The palette is DELIBERATELY ARTIFICIAL — no organic tones,
    no earth colours, no acoustic warmth. Everything is synthetic,
    electric, neon. The colours of a world that never existed.

    THE PERSPECTIVE GRID
    ═══════════════════
    The first form in the system that encodes DEPTH — lines
    converging to a vanishing point, creating the illusion of
    a surface receding into infinite distance.

    VANISHING POINT: (220, 175) — slightly above centre,
    creating the horizon line of the infinite highway.

    STRUCTURE:
    - Horizontal lines: spaced progressively closer as they
      approach the vanishing point (perspective foreshortening)
    - Converging lines: radiating from the vanishing point
      downward and outward to the bottom of the canvas

    This is synthwave's ICONIC image: the neon grid stretching
    to infinity, the Tron landscape, the retrofuture highway.

    Compare to:
    - Detroit Techno grid: FLAT, functional, overhead view
    - Indie Synthpop pulse grid: SMALL, intimate, step sequencer
    - Synthwave perspective grid: DEEP, cinematic, vanishing point
    Three grids, three completely different spatial philosophies.
