  NOISE ROCK — Playlist Cover #162
  Design System: Playlist Cover v1

  SONIC DNA ANALYSIS:
  ═══════════════════
  Noise Rock's defining sonic features:
  1. WEAPONIZED DISTORTION — the defining quality. Distortion
     isn't applied TO the music; distortion IS the music. The
     guitar signal is pushed so far past its operating limit
     that the waveform becomes permanently clipped — the tops
     and bottoms of the waveform sliced flat, creating a
     SQUARE wave where there should be a sine wave. The result:
     pure harmonic aggression. Every overtone screaming.
     This is different from:
     - Shoegaze: distortion as BEAUTY (wall of warm fuzz)
     - Grunge: distortion as RELUCTANCE (dirty amp, tired riff)
     - Metal: distortion as WEIGHT (heavy, controlled, tuned)
     - Noise Rock: distortion as WEAPON (abrasive, confrontational)
  2. RETAINED STRUCTURE — noise rock is NOT noise. Noise abandons
     musical structure entirely. Noise rock RETAINS rock's
     skeleton: verse-chorus, riffs, rhythmic patterns, song
     length. But fills that skeleton with sonic aggression.
     The songs have HOOKS — memorable, propulsive, catchy even —
     but the hooks are barbed. The Jesus Lizard's "Mouth Breather"
     has a riff you can hum — that riff just happens to sound
     like an industrial accident.
  3. RHYTHM AS WEAPON — noise rock's rhythms are PUMMELING.
     Not fast (not blast beats), not complex (not prog), not
     groovy (not funk). HEAVY and DRIVING and BLUNT. The drums
     hit hard, the kick is a punch, the snare cracks. Steve
     Albini's drum machine in Big Black: perfectly quantized,
     perfectly heavy, perfectly merciless. The rhythm is a
     weapon alongside the distortion.
  4. ANGULAR DISSONANCE — noise rock's harmony is DISSONANT.
     Not jazz dissonance (complex, resolved) or atonal
     dissonance (systematic, intellectual). AGGRESSIVE
     dissonance: intervals chosen because they create physical
     discomfort. The guitar tunings are wrong. The intervals
     grate. The harmony attacks the ear.
  5. CONFRONTATIONAL INTENT — noise rock exists to CONFRONT.
     Not to entertain (pop), not to move (dance), not to
     express sadness (emo), not to create beauty (shoegaze).
     To CONFRONT the listener with sonic violence. The loudness
     isn't incidental; it's the point. The ugliness isn't a
     failure; it's the goal.
  6. BASS AS WEAPON — in noise rock, the bass guitar is often
     the primary melodic instrument (Big Black, Lightning Bolt,
     The Jesus Lizard). The bass is distorted, aggressive,
     playing in the midrange where it collides with the guitar
     noise. The collision IS the sound — bass and guitar
     frequency ranges overlapping, fighting for space,
     creating harmonic warfare.

  VISUAL TRANSLATION:
  ═══════════════════
  Background: Harsh near-black (#0a0808) — slightly warm-dark,
    like a small club with bad ventilation and dim incandescent
    bulbs. Not cool (too clean), not neutral (too detached).
    Warm-dark: the temperature of a loud room.
  Central form: THE CLIPPING WAVEFORM — a thick, aggressive
    horizontal stroke that tears across the canvas, bristling
    with sharp vertical projections above and below. This is
    the visual representation of a signal clipped into a
    square wave: the smooth sine wave has been SLICED — the
    tops and bottoms flatten into hard horizontal limits, and
    the transitions between them are VERTICAL (instantaneous,
    not gradual). The projections are the harmonics generated
    by the clipping — overtones screaming at every frequency.
    The stroke is THICK (thickest single-stroke in the system
    outside schranz's wall), OPAQUE (most opaque single form),
    and TEXTURED (distortion marks along its surface).
    COMPARISON to other horizontal forms:
    - Pop Rock waveform: smooth oscillation (healthy signal)
    - Grunge sag: weighted droop (tired signal)
    - Schranz wall: undifferentiated band (compressed signal)
    - Noise Rock clipping waveform: jagged, bristling, BROKEN
      (destroyed signal)
    Pop rock's waveform is the signal. Noise rock's is the
    signal after someone drove a truck over the amplifier.
  Glow: ZERO — like schranz but with ANGER. No atmosphere.
    No warmth. The light in the room is the sparks from the
    amplifier.
  Grain: 30% — VERY HIGH. Everything is distorted. Everything
    clips. The entire signal chain is overdriven from input
    to output. Not as extreme as schranz (35%, digital clipping)
    because noise rock's distortion is ANALOG — tube amps,
    pedal chains, speaker cones shredding.
  Displacement: scale=4 — MAXIMUM tier. Matching schranz and
    frenchcore. The signal is completely warped. The waveform
    bears no resemblance to its input. Total signal destruction.
  Blur: stdDev=1 — SHARP. The abrasion needs to be felt as
    abrasion. Blurred noise rock would be shoegaze. Sharp
    noise rock is noise rock. The transients cut.
  Particles: 0 — ZERO. Twelfth zero-particle cover. There
    are no ornaments in noise rock. There is no beauty to
    decorate. The signal is the weapon and the weapon has
    no embellishment.
  BPM: ~135 BPM → 17 ticks at 17px, kick weight 0.55px
    (HEAVY — the drum hits hard). Uniform weight, uniform
    spacing — the rhythm is BLUNT, not nuanced. The drum
    machine doesn't swing. It HITS.

  FAMILY PLACEMENT:
  ═══════════════════
  Rock → Noise Rock (the confrontational extreme)
  Also inherits from:
  - Punk (confrontational intent, short-form aggression)
  - Industrial (mechanical, weaponized sound)
  - No wave (NYC art-noise, Sonic Youth lineage)

  Noise Rock connects to:
  - Grunge: shares the distortion and disillusionment but
    grunge is TIRED (reluctant heaviness); noise rock is
    ENERGIZED (aggressive weaponization)
  - Shoegaze: shares the wall of distorted guitars but
    shoegaze is BEAUTIFUL (warm, enveloping); noise rock is
    UGLY (abrasive, confrontational)
  - Power Noise: shares the noise-as-material aesthetic but
    power noise is ELECTRONIC (synths, processors); noise
    rock is ANALOG (guitars, amps, pedals)
  - Math Rock: shares the angular rhythm complexity but math
    rock is PRECISE/CLEAN; noise rock is BLUNT/DIRTY
  Key artists: Swans (early), Big Black, Lightning Bolt,
    Melvins, The Jesus Lizard, Shellac, METZ, Daughters,
    Gilla Band, Unsane, Girl Band, Brainiac

  COLOUR RATIONALE:
  ═══════════════════
  Harsh near-black (#0a0808): loud club, bad lighting
  Dirty warm white (#c0b098 → #b0a088): the overdriven signal.
    Not clean white (too pure) or cool grey (too detached).
    DIRTY warm — the colour of a vacuum tube at saturation,
    of a speaker cone at the point of mechanical failure, of
    the light coming through a sweat-fogged window. The
    warmth is analog: tube amps, speaker cones, the physical
    heat of amplification pushed past its limits.
  Harsh off-white (#d0c0a0): the CLIPPING PEAKS — the loudest
    moments, the flat tops of the squared waveform. Brightest
    because these are the moments of maximum overload.
  Dark reddish-brown (#6a4838): the distortion harmonics,
    the overtone screaming. Red-brown because analog
    distortion generates EVEN harmonics that have a warm but
    aggressive character — the specific colour of tube
    saturation.

    THE CLIPPING WAVEFORM
    ═══════════════════
    A thick, aggressive horizontal stroke bristling with sharp
    vertical projections — the visual representation of a signal
    clipped into a square wave.

    The main stroke runs at y≈218 (centre), thick (3.0px —
    the THICKEST single horizontal stroke in the system,
    surpassing grunge's 2.5px). Above and below it, sharp
    vertical projections represent the clipping peaks and
    the harmonic distortion they generate.

    CLIPPING PEAKS (above): sharp vertical bars projecting
    UPWARD from the main stroke — the flat tops of the
    squared waveform, the moments of maximum overload where
    the signal hits the ceiling and STAYS there.

    HARMONIC UNDERTONES (below): shorter, thinner projections
    DOWNWARD — the even harmonics generated by analog
    saturation, the distortion products that fill the
    frequency spectrum.

    The projections are SHARP (hard edges, no rounding) and
    IRREGULAR (not evenly spaced — the clipping is chaotic,
    not rhythmic).

  BPM STRIP — ~135 BPM, blunt pummeling rhythm
  ═══════════════════
  17 ticks at 17px, kick weight 0.55px (HEAVY, blunt).

  The drum machine is merciless. The kick is a punch.
  The snare cracks.

  Same weight as peak techno (0.55px) but different meaning:
  peak techno's weight is DRIVING (propulsive, continuous);
  noise rock's weight is BLUNT (pummeling, confrontational).
