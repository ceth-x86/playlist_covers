  NEW AGE AMBIENT — Playlist Cover #154
  Design System: Playlist Cover v1

  SONIC DNA ANALYSIS:
  ═══════════════════
  New Age Ambient's defining sonic features:
  1. FUNCTIONAL INTENTION — the defining characteristic that
     separates new age from all other ambient subgenres. New age
     ambient is made WITH PURPOSE: to relax, to heal, to
     facilitate meditation, to create a safe space for rest.
     This is not a secondary effect (as relaxation might be for
     classical ambient) — it's the PRIMARY DESIGN GOAL. The music
     is a tool. A beautiful tool, but a tool.
  2. THE SANCTUARY — new age ambient creates a protected,
     warm, unchallenging sonic environment. No dissonance (dark
     ambient), no complexity (minimal ambient), no vastness
     (space ambient), no decay (industrial ambient). Everything
     is resolved. Everything is consonant. Everything is SAFE.
     The sanctuary is a womb of sound — enveloping, warm,
     predictable.
  3. PENTATONIC SIMPLICITY — melodies built on pentatonic scales
     (no semitone intervals, no tension, no dissonance possible).
     The pentatonic scale is mathematically incapable of creating
     anxiety — every note resolves to every other note. New age
     uses this property deliberately: the harmony is structurally
     incapable of tension.
  4. NATURE INTEGRATION — ocean waves, birdsong, rainfall, wind,
     flowing water layered beneath or within the musical texture.
     Nature sounds serve as GROUNDING — connecting the listener
     to the natural world, providing organic rhythm without
     mechanical pulse. The nature sounds are the BPM of new age:
     irregular, organic, comforting.
  5. CRYSTAL/ACOUSTIC TIMBRES — singing bowls (crystal and
     Tibetan), harps, bamboo flutes, gentle piano, wind chimes.
     Instruments chosen for their resonant, overtone-rich,
     physically-soothing timbral qualities. The timbres are
     designed to activate parasympathetic nervous response.
  6. CIRCULAR STRUCTURE — new age ambient doesn't develop
     (classical), decay (industrial/classical ambient), or
     build (trance). It CYCLES — gently returning to its starting
     point, repeating with minimal variation, creating a sense
     of timelessness and safety through gentle, predictable
     circular movement.

  VISUAL TRANSLATION:
  ═══════════════════
  Background: Soft warm dark (#0a0908) — warm, close to
    classical ambient's recital hall but slightly more earthy.
    The darkness of a treatment room, a meditation space,
    a dimly lit sanctuary. Safe, enclosed, not vast.
  Central form: THE EMANATION RINGS — soft concentric rings
    radiating from a warm centre, like the ripples from a
    singing bowl struck once, or the resonance rings of a
    crystal bowl's overtone series. The rings expand outward
    gently, each fainter than the last, creating a smooth,
    symmetric, calming pattern.
    This is the first CONCENTRIC-FROM-CENTRE form that is
    purely about EMANATION rather than pulse (Chicago House)
    or interference (psytrance). Where house's radial pulse
    is rhythmic and psytrance's dual centres create complexity,
    new age's rings are SMOOTH — no pulse, no interference,
    just gentle expansion from a calm centre. The resonance
    of a struck bowl radiating outward.
    The rings are perfectly symmetric — no asymmetry, no
    displacement, no irregularity. The symmetry encodes
    SAFETY — nothing unexpected, nothing off-centre,
    nothing that could disturb.
  Glow: Warm, centred (0.06) — amber-rose warmth emanating
    from the centre. Warmer than space ambient's multi-layered
    cosmic glow, simpler in structure (single source, single
    temperature). The warmth of a healing space, a candle,
    a salt lamp.
  Grain: 10% — LOW. Smooth, clean production. No tape hiss
    (classical ambient), no digital grit (industrial ambient),
    no analog warmth (space ambient). New age production is
    POLISHED — the smoothness is part of the therapeutic intent.
    Nothing rough, nothing textured, nothing that could catch
    or scratch.
  Displacement: scale=0 — ZERO. Nothing warps. Nothing bends.
    The sanctuary is stable. The singing bowl's resonance is
    pure and unaltered.
  Blur: stdDev=6 — MODERATE-HIGH. The gentle diffusion of
    resonance in an intimate room. Not vast (dark ambient 10,
    space ambient 8) and not sharp (minimal ambient 0).
    A warm, enveloping softness — like being wrapped in a
    blanket of sound.
  Particles: 3 warm motes — nature sparkle. The glint of
    sunlight on water, the flash of a crystal facet, the
    momentary brightness of a dewdrop. Warm, gentle, organic.
    Not stellar (space ambient) or structural (pop rock) or
    chromatic (psychedelic). Natural, simple, comforting.
  BPM: NO BPM STRIP — the sixth genre with no rhythm. New age
    ambient's reason: mechanical pulse would create tension,
    would impose structure, would break the sanctuary's
    timelessness. The ocean's rhythm (embedded in the nature
    sounds) is enough — irregular, organic, not metrical.

  FAMILY PLACEMENT:
  ═══════════════════
  The ambient family expands to sextet:
  - Industrial Ambient: ABSENCE (architecture without life)
  - Classical Ambient: PRESENCE (tone still sounding)
  - Dark Ambient: THE VOID (cosmic terror)
  - Minimal Ambient: SUFFICIENCY (one element, enough)
  - Space Ambient: WONDER (cosmic fullness)
  - New Age Ambient: SANCTUARY (therapeutic safety)

  New age is often confused with or looked down upon relative
  to other ambient genres, but it occupies a genuinely distinct
  philosophical position: FUNCTIONAL ambient. It is to ambient
  what liturgical music is to classical — music with purpose
  beyond itself.

  Connects to:
  - Classical Ambient: shares acoustic warmth and gentle
    emotion but classical ambient is AESTHETIC (beauty as end);
    new age is THERAPEUTIC (beauty as means)
  - Space Ambient: shares the warmth and luminosity but space
    ambient explores (the cosmos); new age protects (the self)
  - Spiritual Jazz: shares the healing/transcendent intent
    but spiritual jazz ASCENDS to ecstasy through intensity;
    new age DESCENDS to peace through gentleness

  COLOUR RATIONALE:
  ═══════════════════
  Soft warm dark (#0a0908): meditation room, sanctuary
  Warm amber-rose (#c8a078 → #b89068 → #a88058): the colour
    of a salt lamp, of candlelight through rose quartz, of
    sunset through curtains. Warmer and more ROSE-tinted than
    classical ambient's ivory (which is neutral-warm). The
    rose quality is specific to new age — it suggests healing,
    care, the heart chakra. Not red (too intense) but rose —
    the gentle end of warmth.
  Soft gold (#d0b888): the brightest centre — the singing
    bowl's resonance, the source of the emanation. Warm,
    round, unthreatening.
  Pale lavender (#a898b0): the outermost ring colour — a
    gentle cooling as the resonance expands, like a warm
    sound cooling as it travels through air. The lavender
    connects to spiritual/healing associations without the
    intensity of purple.

    THE EMANATION RINGS
    ═══════════════════
    Soft concentric circles radiating from a warm centre.
    The resonance of a crystal singing bowl struck once —
    the fundamental and its overtones radiating outward as
    visible rings, each fainter and cooler than the last.

    CRITICAL DISTINCTION from other concentric/radial forms:
    - Chicago House radial pulse: concentric but RHYTHMIC
      (each ring = a beat, the kick propelling outward)
    - Psytrance interference: TWO offset concentric systems
      creating emergent complexity
    - New Age emanation: concentric and SMOOTH — no pulse,
      no interference, no rhythm. Pure outward radiation
      from a calm, stable centre.

    House's circles PULSE. Psytrance's circles INTERFERE.
    New age's circles EMANATE.

    The rings are perfectly symmetric — centred at (220, 218),
    no offset, no asymmetry. The symmetry IS the safety.
    Nothing unexpected. Nothing off-balance. Nothing that
    could disturb the sanctuary.

    5 rings, expanding from r=18 to r=90. Each progressively
    fainter (0.22→0.06) and shifting from warm gold (inner)
    toward pale lavender (outer) — the resonance cooling as
    it expands, like sound dissipating through warm air.

    NATURE MOTES — 3 particles

    The glint of sunlight on water. The flash of a crystal

    Warm, gentle, organic. Not stellar (space ambient) or

    Natural, simple, comforting.

    Positioned within the ring field, at different distances
