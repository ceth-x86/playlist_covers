  GRUNGE — Playlist Cover
  Design System: Playlist Cover v1

  SONIC DNA ANALYSIS:
  ═══════════════════
  Grunge's defining sonic features:
  1. THE SAG — grunge's emotional posture is neither rising
     (euphoria) nor falling (despair) nor straight (competence).
     It's SAGGING — the weight of disillusionment, the reluctance
     to care, the heaviness of trying not to try. The guitars
     detune. The tempo drags slightly. The vocal delivery is
     deliberately uncommitted. Everything droops under the weight
     of knowing that effort is futile but making noise anyway.
  2. LOUD-QUIET-LOUD — inherited from the Pixies, perfected by
     Nirvana. Verse: quiet, mumbled, restrained. Chorus: LOUD,
     screamed, distorted. The dynamic contrast IS the form.
     Not the gradual build of trance or the sudden drop of dubstep —
     a binary toggle between whisper and scream with no transition.
  3. DETUNED HEAVINESS — guitars tuned down (drop-D, Eb standard,
     lower), running through cheap amps pushed past their design
     limits. The distortion is not sculpted (metal) or absent
     (indie) — it's the distortion of equipment being ABUSED.
     Buzzing, thick, muddy, heavy.
  4. UNDERPRODUCTION AS AESTHETIC — recorded in cheap studios
     (Reciprocal Recording, Inner Ear), mixed quickly, with
     deliberate rejection of 80s polish. The drums are roomy
     and unpolished. The vocals bleed into the guitar mics.
     The bass is muddy. This isn't lo-fi charm (indie synthpop) —
     it's lo-fi DEFIANCE. We don't WANT to sound good.
  5. AMBIVALENT LYRICS — not punk's political clarity or metal's
     fantastical imagery. Grunge lyrics are about self-loathing,
     alienation, ironic detachment, and the exhaustion of caring.
     "Oh well, whatever, never mind." The delivery matches: mumbled
     verses, screamed choruses that sound more like pain than
     conviction.
  6. FLANNEL-AND-CONCRETE PALETTE — the visual world of grunge is
     brown, grey, olive, mud. Seattle rain, thrift store flannel,
     concrete, coffee. No neon, no chrome, no bright colours.
     The world is overcast.

  VISUAL TRANSLATION:
  ═══════════════════
  Background: Muddy dark brown-grey (#0c0a08) — the colour of a
    Seattle basement in November. Not pure black (too dramatic)
    or blue-black (too atmospheric) or warm brown (too inviting).
    Muddy, overcast, damp.
  Central form: THE SAGGING LINE — a single thick horizontal line
    that DROOPS at its centre under its own weight. Starts at
    a moderate height on the left, sags downward at the centre,
    returns to moderate height on the right. The droop encodes:
    - The weight of disillusionment (gravity pulls it down)
    - The reluctance of the performance (it can't sustain itself)
    - The detuned guitars (the pitch sags, literally)
    The line is THICK (2.5px — among the thickest primary strokes
    in the system) because grunge is HEAVY. Not elegant-heavy
    (baroque pop's ornamental weight) but CRUDE-heavy — blunt,
    distorted, thick.
    Along the line's surface, subtle RAW TEXTURE — slight
    irregularities and roughness encoding the distortion,
    the cheap-amp buzz, the deliberately unpolished production.
    A faint quieter line above the main sag = the quiet verse
    lurking above/behind the loud chorus. The loud-quiet duality.
  Glow: Near-zero (0.02) — the dimmest glow in this session.
    A bare bulb in a practice space. Not atmospheric, not warm,
    not flattering. Just barely enough light to see.
  Grain: 28% — HIGH. The cheap amp distortion, the tape hiss of
    budget recording, the deliberate rejection of polish. Higher
    than psytrance (18%) or synthwave (16%) but lower than
    schranz (35%) because grunge's noise is organic/analog, not
    digital/mechanical.
  Displacement: scale=2 — moderate. The detuning, the slight
    warping of pitch from dropped tuning and worn strings. Not
    extreme warping (psychedelic) but a persistent, low-grade
    distortion of the signal's intended shape.
  Blur: stdDev=2 — LOW. Grunge is not diffuse or atmospheric.
    It's present, immediate, in the room with you. The sound of
    a band playing 3 feet away in a small club. Not sharp/clinical
    (power noise stdDev=1) but not blurred (psychedelic stdDev=8).
    Room sound, not processed sound.
  Particles: 2 motes — the FEWEST non-zero particles in this
    session. Dull, low-opacity, nearly invisible. They represent
    the beauty that grunge BURIES under distortion — the melodic
    gifts of Cobain, Staley, Cornell, Vedder — present but almost
    hidden, like a gorgeous melody mumbled through distortion.
  BPM: ~115 BPM → 16 ticks at 18px, kick weight 0.48px. Even
    but SLIGHTLY DRAGGING — two ticks are spaced 19px instead of
    18px, creating a barely-perceptible drag. The drummer pulling
    slightly behind the beat. Not swing (jazz) or asymmetry
    (avant prog) — just... drag. Reluctance. The beat doesn't
    WANT to be on time.

  FAMILY PLACEMENT:
  ═══════════════════
  Rock lineage:
  Punk + Metal → Grunge (the collision)
  Pop Rock → (distorted) → Grunge → (cleaned up) → Post-Grunge
  Grunge sits at the intersection of punk's attitude and metal's
  heaviness, filtered through indie's lo-fi aesthetic.
  Connects to:
  - Pop Rock: grunge is pop rock's melodic sensibility BURIED under
    distortion and disillusionment. The clean waveform, sagging.
  - Punk: shares the raw production and anti-establishment attitude
    but grunge is TIRED where punk is ANGRY. Punk attacks; grunge
    shrugs.
  - Psychedelic Rock: grunge inherits the feedback and distortion
    but without the cosmic expansion. Psychedelia expands; grunge
    COLLAPSES inward.
  - Shoegaze: contemporary with grunge, shares the wall-of-guitars
    and emotional intensity but shoegaze is BEAUTIFUL where grunge
    is UGLY (deliberately).
  Key artists: Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam,
    Mudhoney, Melvins, Screaming Trees, Stone Temple Pilots,
    Hole, L7

  COLOUR RATIONALE:
  ═══════════════════
  Muddy dark brown-grey (#0c0a08): Seattle basement, overcast
  Dirty amber-grey (#a89878 → #988868): the colour of a worn
    flannel shirt, of coffee-stained concrete, of cheap wood
    panelling in a practice space. Warm but DULL — no polish,
    no shine, no saturation. This is the most muted warm tone
    in the system — where jazz's amber is rich and house's gold
    is bright, grunge's amber is DIRTY.
  Dull olive (#787060): the secondary tone — the colour of a
    military surplus jacket, of moss on concrete, of Seattle
    in the rain. Green-grey, muted, tired.
  The palette is the OPPOSITE of psychedelic rock's chromatic
    saturation and synthwave's neon electricity. Grunge is
    desaturated, muddy, overcast. The visual world of thrift
    stores and rainy parking lots.

    THE SAGGING LINE
    ═══════════════════
    A single thick line that DROOPS at its centre under its own
    weight. The defining visual gesture of grunge: neither
    ascending (trance/spiritual jazz) nor descending (trap) nor
    straight (pop rock) nor angular (post bop) nor spiralling
    (psychedelic rock) nor bursting (uplifting trance).

    SAGGING. The weight of disillusionment. The reluctance of
    the performance. The detuning of the guitars.

    Compare to pop rock's clean waveform:
    Pop rock = smooth sine wave, symmetric, balanced (the centre)
    Grunge = the same wave, WEIGHTED DOWN at its centre,
      thick and distorted (the centre, tired)

    Psychedelic rock took pop rock's wave and SPIRALLED it outward.
    Grunge takes pop rock's wave and WEIGHS it down.

    The sag is approximately 20px below where a straight line
    would be — not dramatic (that would require caring about drama)
    but persistent, heavy, undeniable.

  16 ticks at 18px, kick weight 0.48px (moderate-heavy).

  Not swing (jazz's deliberate rhythmic feel) and not
