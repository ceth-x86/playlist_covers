  ATMOSPHERIC BLACK METAL — Playlist Cover #156
  Design System: Playlist Cover v1

  SONIC DNA ANALYSIS:
  ═══════════════════
  Atmospheric Black Metal's defining sonic features:
  1. THE TREMOLO WALL AS LANDSCAPE — the genre's core
     recontextualization. Traditional black metal's tremolo-
     picked guitar (rapid alternation on a single chord,
     creating a buzzing, swarming texture) is retained but
     its MEANING changes. In traditional black metal, the
     tremolo wall is aggression — fury, hatred, Satan. In
     atmospheric black metal, the tremolo wall becomes
     LANDSCAPE — a vast, shimmering, overwhelming expanse
     that evokes mountain ranges, forests, oceans, sky.
     The SAME technique encoding OPPOSITE content: hatred
     versus awe. The tremolo wall's sonic texture naturally
     suggests immensity — when you stop hearing individual
     notes and start hearing a continuous shimmering mass,
     the mass becomes a place. A landscape.
  2. LAYERED DEPTH — atmospheric black metal builds depth
     through LAYERING. Multiple guitar tracks at different
     levels, keyboards/synths providing background atmosphere,
     bass creating sub-harmonic foundation, the entire mix
     creating a sense of RECEDING PLANES — foreground (blast
     beat, tremolo), middle ground (harmonic movement, bass),
     background (keyboards, ambient texture, reverb). Like
     looking at a mountain range: the nearest ridge is sharpest,
     each successive ridge fainter, until the furthest dissolves
     into sky.
  3. INTERPLAY OF FEROCITY AND BEAUTY — the genre's emotional
     signature. A passage of screaming, blast-beating tremolo
     fury transitions into a passage of clean guitars,
     ambient synths, and quiet beauty — then builds back into
     fury. The oscillation between extremes IS the genre.
     Not the loud-quiet of grunge (binary toggle) but a
     GRADUAL transition — fury dissolving into beauty,
     beauty building back into fury. The storm and the clearing.
  4. VAST TIME SCALE — compositions run 10-20 minutes. The
     length isn't indulgence; it's necessary to create the
     sense of JOURNEY. A 3-minute song can't traverse a
     mountain range. 15 minutes can. The listener travels
     through the landscape, experiencing its changes over
     the timespan of an actual walk through wilderness.
  5. NATURE WORSHIP — the lyrical and philosophical content.
     Not Satan (traditional black metal), not politics (punk),
     not self-loathing (grunge). NATURE — forests, mountains,
     seasons, rivers, sky, weather, the sublime experience of
     insignificance before vast natural forces. The music IS
     the landscape, not a description of it.
  6. PRODUCTION AESTHETIC — neither lo-fi (raw black metal's
     deliberate ugliness) nor polished (death metal's clinical
     precision). VAST — big reverb, wide stereo field, the
     guitars layered into a continuous mass, but with enough
     clarity to hear the harmonic movement within the wall.
     The production creates SPACE — the space of the landscape.

  VISUAL TRANSLATION:
  ═══════════════════
  Background: Deep cold blue-green (#060808) — the colour of
    a mountain forest at twilight, where the sky is still
    faintly visible above the treeline. Not pure black (too
    claustrophobic), not blue-black (too cosmic), not warm
    (no warmth in the mountain pre-dawn). Cold, green-tinged,
    atmospheric.
  Central form: THE RECEDING RIDGELINES — multiple overlapping
    horizontal bands at different vertical positions and
    opacities, each representing a mountain ridge receding
    into distance/mist. The nearest ridge is lowest on the
    canvas, widest, and most opaque. Each successive ridge
    is higher, narrower, and fainter — encoding atmospheric
    perspective: the further the ridge, the more it dissolves
    into the atmosphere.
    Each ridge is rendered not as a smooth line but as a
    slightly textured band — encoding the tremolo wall's
    swarming, shimmering quality. The texture IS the tremolo.
    The ridges ARE the guitars.
    This is the first ATMOSPHERIC PERSPECTIVE form in the
    system — depth encoded through opacity gradation and
    vertical stacking, as opposed to synthwave's geometric
    perspective (converging lines). Atmospheric perspective
    is how NATURE creates depth; geometric perspective is
    how MACHINES create depth.
  Glow: Cold blue-green (0.035) — the pre-dawn light on the
    mountain. Not warm (no sun yet), not absent (there IS
    light, dim and cold). The glow comes from above (the sky),
    not from the centre (the form). First TOP-POSITIONED glow.
  Grain: 24% — moderate-high. The lo-fi heritage of black
    metal, the deliberate roughness of the guitar tone, the
    tape-recorded quality of many atmospheric black metal albums.
    Not as extreme as raw black metal (which might be 40%+)
    but distinctly grainy — the texture serves the landscape.
  Displacement: scale=2 — the tremolo shimmer, the constant
    micro-movement within the guitar wall. The landscape
    isn't static; it shimmers with the tremolo picking's
    vibrational energy.
  Blur: stdDev=5 — HIGH but not maximal. The atmospheric
    reverb, the distance haze, the way the further ridges
    dissolve. But less blurry than dark ambient (10) or
    industrial ambient (9) because atmospheric black metal
    has FOREGROUND DETAIL — the blast beat, the nearest
    guitar layer, the scream. The near is sharp; the far
    is blurred. DEPTH through differential blur.
  Particles: 3 cold motes — stars visible above the highest
    ridge, or snow particles in mountain air, or the first
    light of dawn breaking through cloud. Cold, high-positioned,
    faint. Not warm (new age) or chromatic (psychedelic).
    The cold light of mountain altitude.
  BPM: ~180 BPM → 18 ticks at 15px, kick weight 0.4px
    (lighter than schranz despite similar speed). THE BLAST
    BEAT — fast, continuous, but LIGHTER than industrial
    genres' heavy kicks because atmospheric black metal's
    blast beat is TEXTURE, not impact. The blast beat at
    this speed becomes a shimmer, not a series of hits.
    The BPM strip itself is a tremolo — the visual rhythm
    dissolves into continuous presence at this density.

  FAMILY PLACEMENT:
  ═══════════════════
  Black Metal → Atmospheric Black Metal (the transcendent wing)
  This is the point where black metal INVERTS: same techniques
  (tremolo, blast beat, screaming), opposite meaning (nature
  worship instead of Satan worship, beauty instead of ugliness,
  transcendence instead of transgression).

  Connects to:
  - Post-Rock: shares the long builds, the vast dynamics, the
    emotional transcendence. Atmospheric black metal IS black
    metal + post-rock's sensibility.
  - Shoegaze: shares the wall of guitars as texture, the
    beauty-through-distortion. "Blackgaze" (Alcest, Deafheaven)
    makes this connection explicit.
  - Space Ambient: shares the vast scale and sense of awe,
    but space ambient is ELECTRONIC and cosmic; atmospheric
    black metal is ORGANIC and terrestrial.
  - Spiritual Jazz: shares the transcendence-through-intensity,
    the long-form journey, the overwhelming build. One ascends
    through devotion; the other through landscape.
  Key artists: Wolves in the Throne Room, Agalloch, Alcest,
    Panopticon, Deafheaven, Summoning, Saor, Falls of Rauros,
    Elderwind, Fen, Drudkh, Winterfylleth

  COLOUR RATIONALE:
  ═══════════════════
  Deep cold blue-green (#060808): mountain twilight
  Cold silver-blue (#8898a8 → #7888a0 → #607080): the colour
    of mountain ridges at dawn — not warm (no sunlight yet),
    not pure blue (terrestrial, not cosmic), not grey (alive,
    not dead). Silver-blue: the cold light reflected off stone
    and ice and forest canopy. Each successive ridge cooler
    and more blue — the atmospheric perspective makes distant
    mountains bluer.
  Faint green-grey (#506858): the forest on the nearest ridge —
    the treeline, the organic element, the green that
    distinguishes this from pure mountain rock.
  Pale cold white (#b0b8c0): the highest, most distant ridge —
    almost the colour of the sky itself, the ridge dissolving
    into atmosphere.

    THE RECEDING RIDGELINES
    ═══════════════════
    Multiple overlapping horizontal bands representing mountain
    ridges receding into distance and mist. Each successive
    ridge is:
    - HIGHER on the canvas (further away = higher in visual field)
    - FAINTER (atmospheric perspective: distance = lower contrast)
    - MORE BLURRED (distance = more atmospheric diffusion)
    - COOLER/BLUER (atmospheric scattering shifts distant objects blue)
    - NARROWER (further away = appears smaller)

    This is the first ATMOSPHERIC PERSPECTIVE form in the system.
    Synthwave uses GEOMETRIC perspective (converging parallel lines).
    Atmospheric black metal uses ATMOSPHERIC perspective (opacity,
    colour shift, blur gradation). Nature's depth vs machine's depth.

    FIVE RIDGELINES, from nearest (bottom) to furthest (top):
    1. Nearest: forest ridge, greenish, widest, most opaque, least blurred
    2. Second: mountain ridge, silver-blue, slightly higher/fainter
    3. Third: distant ridge, cooler blue, mid-blur
    4. Fourth: far ridge, pale blue-grey, high blur
    5. Furthest: horizon ridge, nearly the colour of sky, maximum blur

    Each ridge has a slightly uneven top edge (the treeline,
    the mountain silhouette) created by the path shape,
    enhanced by the tremolo displacement filter.

  BPM STRIP — ~180 BPM, blast beat shimmer
  ═══════════════════
  18 ticks at 15px, kick weight 0.4px (LIGHT despite high speed).
  The blast beat at this speed becomes TEXTURE, not individual
  impacts. The ticks are close enough and light enough that they
  approach a continuous shimmer — like the tremolo picking itself.

  The BPM strip IS the tremolo: rhythm dissolving into texture
  at extreme speed. Lighter than schranz (0.65px at 155 BPM)
  because atmospheric black metal's blast beat serves
  ATMOSPHERE, not AGGRESSION.

  Starting x = (600 - 17*15) / 2 = 172.5 ≈ 173
