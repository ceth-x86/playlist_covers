  PROGRESSIVE HOUSE — Playlist Cover #157
  Design System: Playlist Cover v1

  SONIC DNA ANALYSIS:
  ═══════════════════
  Progressive House's defining sonic features:
  1. GRADUAL TRANSFORMATION — the absolute core principle.
     Elements enter so slowly you don't notice them arriving.
     Elements leave so slowly you don't notice them departing.
     Filter sweeps span 64 bars. Pad layers evolve over 4
     minutes. Reverb tails lengthen imperceptibly. The
     transformation is SO GRADUAL that it's effectively
     imperceptible in real-time — you only realize the entire
     texture has changed when you compare where you are to
     where you were 5 minutes ago. This is the opposite of
     drop culture (EDM), loud-quiet toggle (grunge), or
     sudden dynamic shifts (post bop).
  2. THE LONG ARC — where uplifting trance builds to ONE peak
     and releases, progressive house traces a LONG, PATIENT
     ARC across 10+ minutes. The arc might rise, plateau,
     descend, rise again — but all movements are gradual.
     No sudden drops. No breakdowns (or rather, the breakdown
     lasts 3 minutes). The journey IS the destination.
  3. THE KICK AS ANCHOR — the four-on-the-floor kick is the
     ONE constant. Everything above it transforms: pads shift,
     melodies emerge and dissolve, effects wash in and out.
     The kick is the horizon line — the fixed reference point
     against which all change is measured. Without the kick's
     constancy, the gradual change would have no anchor and
     would feel like ambient drift rather than progressive
     movement.
  4. DELAYED MELODIC FRAGMENTS — not full melodies (pop) or
     hooks (dance pop) or riffs (rock). FRAGMENTS — 3-4 note
     phrases that appear in the delay tail, echo, overlap with
     their own echoes, build up into quasi-melodic patterns
     that were never explicitly composed. The melody emerges
     from the delay structure, not from the notation.
  5. MIDNIGHT PALETTE — progressive house is 2am-5am music.
     Peak-hour has passed (that was trance/dance pop). The
     crowd has thinned to the dedicated. The lights have
     dimmed. The DJ is playing for the journey, not the
     peak. The emotional register: introspective, hypnotic,
     warm but deep, forward-moving but unhurried.
  6. WARM DEPTH — progressive house has DEPTH without dark
     ambient's void or industrial ambient's decay. Warm bass,
     warm pads, warm delays — but extending into deep,
     cavernous space. The depth of a good club at 3am: the
     sound system reveals sub-bass that you feel in your
     body, the reverb extends the room into an infinite space.

  VISUAL TRANSLATION:
  ═══════════════════
  Background: Warm deep blue-dark (#080810) — midnight blue,
    the colour of the sky at 3am in summer, or the deep blue
    lighting of a progressive house set. Not cold (too clinical)
    and not black (too empty). Warm-leaning midnight.
  Central form: THE LONG GRADIENT — a single horizontal band
    that transitions seamlessly from one colour/opacity state
    on the left to another on the right. The gradient IS the
    transformation: the left side represents the track's
    opening state, the right side represents where it arrives
    10 minutes later. The transition between them is SO SMOOTH
    that no single point can be identified as "where it changed."
    This is the first PURE GRADIENT form in the system — a
    form whose identity IS its smooth transition. Other covers
    use gradients (classical ambient's decay, uplifting trance's
    intensifying arc) but as properties OF a form. Progressive
    house's gradient IS the form. Nothing else. The transition
    is the content.
  Glow: Warm midnight (0.05) — the deep warmth of a good
    sound system, the amber-blue of late-night club lighting.
    Warmer than EBM's fluorescent but cooler than new age's
    sanctuary. The specific temperature of 3am.
  Grain: 14% — clean but not clinical. Professional production
    with depth and warmth. Progressive house is well-produced
    music — the gradual transformations require precise mixing
    and mastering to maintain clarity through long filter sweeps.
  Displacement: scale=1 — subtle. The gentle modulation of
    the filter sweep, the LFO on the pad, the micro-movement
    within the sound. Not warping but MODULATING — slow,
    controlled, intentional movement.
  Blur: stdDev=5 — MODERATE-HIGH. The reverb depth of the
    club space, the delay tails feeding back, the way the
    sound extends into warm darkness. Higher than house
    genres typically get because progressive house's reverb
    is part of the journey — the space the sound travels
    through IS the composition.
  Particles: 3 warm motes — delayed melodic fragments. The
    notes that appear in the delay tail and shimmer independently.
    Warm, evenly spaced across the gradient (left, centre,
    right), representing the melodic content that emerges at
    different points in the transformation.
  BPM: ~124 BPM → 16 ticks at 18px, kick weight 0.45px
    (moderate, warm, constant). THE ANCHOR — every tick
    identical, perfectly even. The four-on-the-floor that
    doesn't change while everything else transforms above it.
    Same tempo and weight as pop rock but with DIFFERENT
    MEANING: pop rock's even beat is baseline normalcy;
    progressive house's even beat is the ANCHOR against which
    10 minutes of gradual change unfolds.

  FAMILY PLACEMENT:
  ═══════════════════
  House → Progressive House (the journey wing)
  House → Chicago House (the heartbeat)
  House → Deep House (the warmth)
  House → Dance Pop (the peak-hour)

  Progressive house connects to:
  - Uplifting Trance: both build over long durations, but
    trance builds to a DEFINED PEAK (the arc bursts);
    progressive house builds toward TRANSFORMATION (the
    gradient shifts). Peak vs gradient.
  - Minimal Techno: shares the hypnotic repetition and
    patience but minimal techno REDUCES (taking away);
    progressive house TRANSFORMS (replacing gradually).
  - Psytrance: shares the hypnotic repetition but psytrance
    creates INTERFERENCE (two patterns overlapping);
    progressive house creates TRANSITION (one state becoming
    another).
  - Space Ambient: shares the vast, luminous warmth but
    space ambient has no beat (pure field); progressive house
    has the constant kick (field + anchor).

  COLOUR RATIONALE:
  ═══════════════════
  Warm deep blue-dark (#080810): midnight, 3am
  Left state — warm amber-bronze (#b89060 → #c8a070): the
    opening — warm, bass-heavy, amber-toned. The sound of
    the kick and bass establishing the groove, before the
    higher elements enter. The warm low end.
  Right state — cool lavender-blue (#6878a8 → #5868a0): the
    arrival — cooler, higher, more ethereal. The pads have
    opened, the filter has swept up, the melody fragment
    shimmers in the delay. The cool high end.
  The gradient from warm-left to cool-right encodes the
    classic progressive house transformation: from bass-heavy
    groove to ethereal, melodic, atmospheric plateau. The
    frequency spectrum itself as the transformation axis:
    low/warm → high/cool.

    THE LONG GRADIENT
    ═══════════════════
    The first PURE GRADIENT form in the entire system.
    The gradient IS the form. Nothing else.

    Three horizontal layers encoding the frequency spectrum
    of the transformation:
    1. SUB-BASS (below): warm, constant, the anchor frequency
    2. MID-RANGE (centre): THE GRADIENT — the primary
       transformation band, warm amber → cool lavender-blue
    3. HIGH SHIMMER (above): the filter opening gradually,
       more present on the right (arrival state) than left

    The three layers together show the full frequency spectrum
    transforming: lows stay warm; mids transition; highs emerge.

    Compare to other horizontal forms:
    - Pop Rock waveform: oscillating (active, present)
    - Grunge sag: drooping (exhausted)
    - Schranz wall: packed strokes (compressed)
    - Classical Ambient tone: fading (decaying)
    - Minimal Ambient line: constant (sufficient)
    - Progressive House gradient: TRANSITIONING (transforming)

    The sixth horizontal philosophy. The form that BECOMES.

  BPM STRIP — ~124 BPM, the constant anchor
  ═══════════════════
  16 ticks at 18px, kick weight 0.45px (moderate, warm).
  EVERY TICK IDENTICAL. THE ANCHOR.

  While the central form transforms from warm to cool across
  its entire length, the BPM strip beneath is UNCHANGING —
  the four-on-the-floor that doesn't vary. The fixed reference
  point against which all transformation is measured.

  Same tempo and weight as pop rock's baseline rhythm,
  but the MEANING is different: pop rock's evenness is
  normalcy; progressive house's evenness is the CONSTANT
  that makes gradual change perceptible.
