  SPIRITUAL JAZZ — Playlist Cover
  Design System: Playlist Cover v1

  SONIC DNA ANALYSIS:
  ═══════════════════
  Spiritual Jazz's defining sonic features:
  1. THE ASCENT — music that builds vertically toward transcendence.
     Not horizontal development (post bop's angular journey through form)
     but VERTICAL intensification — the same modal center sustained and
     amplified until it breaks through into ecstasy. Coltrane's sheets
     of sound rising, Sanders' overblown harmonics screaming upward,
     Alice Coltrane's harp glissandi ascending.
  2. MODAL DRONES — sustained tonal centers, often on one chord for
     extended periods. The harmony doesn't "go" anywhere — it DEEPENS.
     The stillness of the harmonic foundation creates space for the
     vertical ascent above it.
  3. COLLECTIVE ECSTASY — unlike post bop's composed sophistication,
     spiritual jazz is COMMUNAL. The entire ensemble rises together.
     No single soloist dominates — the group lifts as one, like a
     congregation in prayer.
  4. EASTERN/AFRICAN ELEMENTS — bells, tambura, oud, sitar, kalimba,
     hand drums. Non-Western scales and tuning. The influence of
     Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, and African spirituality on the music.
     Alice Coltrane's Vedantic devotion. Sanders' Sufi-inflected
     overblowing. Sun Ra's Afrofuturist cosmology.
  5. CHANTING AND VOICE — Om, devotional singing, wordless vocals.
     The human voice as instrument of prayer, not lyric delivery.
  6. HYPNOTIC REPETITION — ostinato bass patterns, cycling piano
     figures, persistent drum patterns that create trance states.
     Repetition as meditation technology.
  7. SOPRANO SAXOPHONE AS SPIRITUAL VOICE — Coltrane's soprano sax
     became the defining instrument: piercing, nasal, reed-thin,
     capable of reaching into the upper harmonics where the sound
     becomes pure vibration.

  VISUAL TRANSLATION:
  ═══════════════════
  Background: Deep indigo-black (#08061a) — the cosmic void from
    which light emerges. Darker and more saturated than post bop's
    slate. The indigo has spiritual weight — it's the colour of
    pre-dawn sky, of deep meditation, of the space between worlds.
  Central form: THE ASCENDING COLUMN — a vertical beam of light
    rising from a resonant base at the bottom of the SVG field,
    narrowing and intensifying upward, then EXPANDING and DISSOLVING
    at the top into luminous particles. This is the first primarily
    VERTICAL central form in the system (most forms are horizontal
    or centered). The verticality is the point — spiritual jazz is
    about ASCENT. The column represents:
    - Base (wide, warm): the modal drone, the bass ostinato, the earth
    - Middle (narrowing, brightening): the building intensity,
      the collective crescendo, the soprano sax cutting upward
    - Top (expanding, dissolving): the breakthrough, the ecstatic
      release, the moment where sound becomes light
  Glow: Warm gold-white (0.09) — luminous, spiritual, radiant.
    The BRIGHTEST non-party glow in this session. This is the light
    of A Love Supreme, the golden glow of devotion. Positioned at
    the upper portion of the column where the ascent peaks.
  Grain: 15% — clean but with analog presence. Spiritual jazz was
    recorded at places like Van Gelder's and Impulse! studios with
    excellent engineering, but the music has organic warmth.
  Displacement: scale=2 — subtle trembling. The vibration of
    sustained collective playing, the shimmer of a tamboura drone,
    the wavering of a soprano sax in the altissimo register.
  Blur: stdDev=7 — significant. The music WASHES — reverb, bleed
    between instruments, the halo of sustained tones. More blur
    than post bop (3) because spiritual jazz is about immersion,
    not clarity. The blur is the devotional space.
  Particles: 8 luminous motes — scattered above the column's
    dissolution point, representing the harmonic overtones that
    break free when Sanders overblows his tenor, when Alice Coltrane's
    harp cascades upward. These are the freed tones — sound
    becoming light. More particles than post bop (5) because
    spiritual jazz is more ecstatic, more generous, more overflowing.
  BPM: ~150 BPM feel → 14 ticks at 22px, kick weight 0.3px
    (VERY light — the lightest in this session). The pulse in
    spiritual jazz is felt more than heard — the drums create
    a WASH of rhythm rather than a marked beat. Ticks are uniform
    and meditative, with no accents — the rhythm is a drone,
    a mantra, not a groove.

  FAMILY PLACEMENT:
  ═══════════════════
  Jazz lineage: Modal Jazz (open harmony) → Post Bop (bent structure)
    → Spiritual Jazz (transcendent ascent) → Free Jazz (total liberation)
  Spiritual Jazz also connects SIDEWAYS to:
  - Classic Ambient: shares the drone, the stasis, the immersion
    (but ambient removes rhythm; spiritual jazz keeps the pulse as prayer)
  - Psybient: shares the Eastern influence and trance state
    (but psybient is electronic; spiritual jazz is acoustic)
  - Pagan Folk: shares the devotional/ritualistic intent
    (different tradition, same function of music-as-worship)
  Compared to Post Bop: post bop BENDS structure intellectually;
    spiritual jazz ASCENDS through structure emotionally.
    Post bop's line is horizontal with angles; spiritual jazz's
    column is vertical with luminance.
  Compared to Modal Jazz: modal jazz creates SPACE for exploration;
    spiritual jazz fills that space with DEVOTION. Same harmonic
    foundation, opposite use of the openness.
  Key artists: John Coltrane (A Love Supreme, Meditations, Om),
    Pharoah Sanders (Karma, Thembi), Alice Coltrane (Journey in
    Satchidananda, Ptah the El Daoud), Sun Ra, Leon Thomas,
    Don Cherry, Kamasi Washington (modern)

  COLOUR RATIONALE:
  ═══════════════════
  Deep indigo-black (#08061a): cosmic void, pre-dawn meditation,
    the darkness from which spiritual light emerges. Indigo is
    the colour of the sixth chakra (the third eye, inner vision)
    in Hindu tradition — fitting for music deeply influenced by
    Vedantic philosophy.
  Warm gold (#d4a830 → #c89428 → #e0b840): spiritual radiance,
    the golden light of devotion. Brighter than Chicago House's
    amber (which is earthly warmth) and brighter than jazz rock's
    amber (which is tradition). This gold is LUMINOUS — it glows
    from within, like the light described in devotional texts.
  White-gold (#f0e0b0): the purest form of the light at the top
    of the column, where sound dissolves into vibration.
  Deep warm brown (#5a3a18): the earth-tone base of the column,
    representing the bass ostinato, the grounding drone.
  The palette is a vertical gradient: earth (brown) → warmth (gold)
    → light (white-gold) → dissolution (indigo). This IS the
    spiritual journey: grounded → building → transcending → merging.

    THE ASCENDING COLUMN
    ═══════════════════
    The first primarily VERTICAL central form in the system.
    Almost every other cover has horizontal or centered forms:
    - Dubstep: horizontal wobble
    - Trap: descending 808 slide
    - Post Bop: horizontal bent axis
    - Chicago House: centered radial pulse

    Spiritual Jazz's column RISES — bottom to top = earth to light.
    This is the sonic ascent: bass drone → collective crescendo →
    soprano sax altissimo → overtone dissolution.

    The column has three zones:
    BASE (wide, warm brown): the modal drone, the bass ostinato,
      the rhythmic foundation. Wide because the foundation is broad.
    MIDDLE (narrowing, brightening gold): the building intensity.
      The soprano sax enters, the collective volume rises, the
      harmonics thicken. Narrowing because the energy focuses.
    TOP (expanding, dissolving white-gold): the breakthrough.
      The moment where Sanders overblows and the sound shatters
      into pure harmonics. Expanding and dissolving because
      transcendence is boundaryless.

    LUMINOUS MOTES — 8 particles
    ═══════════════════
    Freed harmonic overtones scattered above and around the
    dissolution zone. These are the tones that break loose when
    Sanders overblows, when Alice Coltrane's harp shimmers,
    when the collective intensity shatters into pure vibration.

    8 particles — the most in this session for a non-electronic
    genre. Spiritual jazz is OVERFLOWING — unlike post bop's
    restrained 5 or cool jazz's hypothetical 2-3. The ecstasy
    is generous, abundant, cascading.

    All warm gold/white-gold — unified in colour because the
    collective is unified in purpose. No cool/warm split like
    jazz rock — spiritual jazz is ALL warmth, ALL devotion.

  BPM STRIP — ~150 BPM meditative pulse
  ═══════════════════
  14 ticks at 22px, kick weight 0.3px — the LIGHTEST kick in this
  session AND potentially in the system (tied with Dream Pop 0.25px
  area). The pulse in spiritual jazz is FELT, not STRUCK. The drums
  create a wash of rhythm — Rashied Ali's multi-directional
  cymbal patterns, Elvin Jones' polyrhythmic roil.

  ALL TICKS UNIFORM — no accents, no displacement, no variation.
  The rhythm is a MANTRA: same intensity, same weight, continuous,
  hypnotic. This is repetition as meditation technology.
  Compare to frenchcore's uniform wall (martial aggression) —
  spiritual jazz's uniform strip is meditative stillness.
  Same technique, opposite spiritual charge.
